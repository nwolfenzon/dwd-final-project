And I remember what you
said to me...
You were acting so strange...

And maybe I was too blind to see
that you needed a change.

Was it something I said,
To make you turn away,
To make you walked out and leave me cold

If I could just find a way
To make it so that you were right here...
right now...

I've been sitting here

be strong
I've drove my self insane
Wishing I could touch your face...
But the truth remains you're
Gone...(your gone...baby your....gone your gone baby girl your.. gone ...your gone...your)

Now, I don’t wanna make excuses baby,
Won’t change the fact that you're gone...

could do
Won’t you please let me know...
The time is passing so slowly now...
Guess that my life without you
(guess that my life without you )
And maybe I could change my everyday
But baby I don’t want to.

SO I'll just hang around
And find something’s to do
To take my mind off missing you...

Those who wish to follow me (My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior without the sound of guns

[2Pac]
If I could recelect before my hood dayz
I'd sit and reminisce, nigga and bliss on the good dayz
i stop and stare at the younger, my heart goes to'em
They tested, it was stressed that they under
In our days, things changed
Everyone's ashamed to the youth cuz the truth looks strange
And for me it's reversed, we left them a world that's cursed, and it hurts
cause any day they'll push the button
and yall condemned like Malcolm x and Bobby Hunton, died for nothin
Don't them let me get teary, the world looks dreary
but when you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
there's no need for you to fear me
if you take the time to hear me, maybe you can learn to cheer me
it aint about black or white, cuz we're human
I hope we see the light before its ruined

Tell me do you see that old lady aint it sad
Living out a bag, but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there there's a lady, crack got her crazy
Guess she's given birth to a baby
I don't trip and let it fade me, from outta the frying pan
We jump into another form of slavery
Even now I keep discouraged
Wonder if they take it all back while I still keep the courage
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottle
I make mistakes, but learn from every one
And when its said and done
I bet this Brotha be a better one
If I'm upset, you don't stress
Never forget, that God hasn't finished with me yet
I feel his hand on my brain
When I write rhymes, I go blind, and let the lord do his thang
But am I less holy
Cuz I choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace in that war on the streets
My ghetto gospel

Those who wish to follow me (Yeah My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior without the sound of guns

11,1825.0,2Pac,Until the End of Time,"Perhaps I was addicted to tha dark side
Some where inside my childhood I missed my heart die
And even though we both came from tha same places
Tha money and tha fame made us all change places
Could it be through tha misery
That came to past ,
the hard times make a true friend afraid to ask,
for currency,
but u could run to me when u need me,
i'll never leave honestly someone to believe in as u can see.
this is our thang through and true
What can I do real homies help you get through
And comin' new he'd do tha same thang if he could
Cuz in tha hood true homies make you feel good
And happy times we be actin' up call tha cops
Bringin' tha cease to tha peace that was on my block
It never stop, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah but it's clear I'll always be tha same
Until the end of time

Chorus:

So take, these Broken Wings
I need your hands to come & heal me once again,
(Until The End Of Time)
So I can fly , until the end of time
(Until The End Of Time, Until The End Of Time)

Verse Two

Please Lord forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know I don't hang around tha house much
This all night money makin' got me outta touch, shit
Ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of tha ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin' solo
Ride out alone in my low-low
Watchin' tha whole world move in slow mo
For quiet times I disappear and listen to tha ocean
Smokin' pots think my thoughts
Then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world
My phony homie had a baby by my own girl
But I ain't trippin' I'm a playa
I ain't sweatin' him
I his sister had her mo' good like a Mexican
His next of kin
No remorse it was meant to happen
Besides rappin' tha only thing I did good was scrappin'
Until tha end of time

Chorus:

So take, these Broken Wings
I need your hands to come & heal me once again,
(Until The End Of Time)
So we can fly , until the end of time

take these Broken Wings,
you've got to learn to fly, n learn to live so free
(Until The End Of Time)
So we can fly, until the end of time
(Time, Until The End Of Time)

Verse Three:

Now who's to say if I was right or wrong?
To live my life,
As an Outlaw all alone
Remain strong in this planet full of playa hataz
They conversate 'bout Death Row full of demonstrators
And in tha end drinkin' henessey made all my enemies envy me
So go when I flow eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for their right to breath
While beggin' me to keep tha peace haha
Well I can see close into achieve
In times of danger don't freeze time to be a G
Follow my lead I supply everything you need
An ounce of game and tha trainin' to make a G'
Remember me?
As an Outcast Outlaw
Another album out that's what I'm about more,
gettin' raw 'till tha day I see my casket
Buried as a G' while tha whole world remembers me
Until the end of time

Chorus:
So take, these Broken Wings
(So take, these Broken Wings)
I need your hands to come & heal me once again, (once again, once again)
(Until The End Of Time)
So we can fly , until the end of time

take these broken wings,
you'v got to learn to learn to fly n learn to live so free
so we can fly, until the end of time

How good it is with me

Hey yo you promised me Kate Spade
But that was last year boy in the 8th grade
But you ain't Biggie baby boy, so no it ain't ""one more chance""
And when yo friends around you don't wanna hold my hand
And now you see a girl stylin' and wildin' inside the mix
Hoppin' out the whips the whips the five and six
Yes fly crone, so pardon my tone
Here go a quarter go call Tyrone

For little money, just tips for pay

New York City
You are now riding
With 50 Cent
You gotta love it

I just wanna chill and twist a lot
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy shorty I
Need to see you and feel you next to me

I provide everything you need and I
Like your smile I don't wanna see you cry
Got some questions that I gotta ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers babe

[Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me? Girl

[50 Cent]
If I feel off tomorrow would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?

If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?

I'd get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flipped burgers in Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin' me?

And in the bed if I use my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back?
Now we can have a lil' drink you know a nightcap
And we can go do what you like, I know you like that

[Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now

Would you still have love for me?

[50 Cent]
Now would you leave me if you're father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?
Are you mad 'cause I'm askin' you 21 questions?
Are you my soul mate? 'Cause if so, girl you a blessing

Do you trust me enough, to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at ya' trying figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how

If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see?
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? Or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?

We only humans girl we make mistakes
To make it up I do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style I say anything to make you smile

You gon' back that thing up or should i push up on it
Temperature risin, okay lets go to the next level
Dance floor jam packed, hot as a tea kettle
I'll break it down for you now, baby it's simple
If you be a nympho I'll be a nypmho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental,
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasin you 'bout how sprung I gotcha
Wanna show me how you work it baby, no problem
Get on top then get to bouncing round like a low rider
I'm a seasoned fit when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat you can play with the stick
I'm tryin to explain baby the best way I can
I melt in your mouth girl, not in your hands (ha ha)

And where we do (and where we do)
The things we do (things we do)
Are just between me and you (oh yeah)

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Give it to me baby, nice and slow
Climb on top, ride like you in the rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door she get to pullin on my zipper
It's like it's a race who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic how erotic it is to watch her in thongs
Had me thinking 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touch the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she winds
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
As Long as she ain't stoppin, homie I aint stoppin
Drippin wet with sweat man its on and popping
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle its on
And we gon' sip til every bubble in the bottle is gone

We do this all tha tyme, right now we on tha grind
So hurry up and copy and go selling nicks and dimes
Shorty she so fyne, I gotta make her mine
A ass like that gotta be one of a kind
I crush 'em everytime, punch 'em with every line
I'm fuckin with they mind
I make 'em press rewind
They know they can't shine if I'm around the rhyme
Been on parole since 94 cause I commit tha crime
I send you my line, I did it three ta nine
If D's ran up in my crib, you know who droppin dimes

Can it be my De La clothes

It's just me myself and I

Now you tease my Plug One style
And my Plug One spectacles
You say Plug One and Two are hippies

Always pushing that we've formed an image

Right is wrong when hype is written

Style is surely our own thing
Not the false disguise of showbiz
De La Soul is from the soul

Strictly from the Dan called Stuckie

Glory for Plugs One and Two

By kizids and dookie eyes

And he states, 'Black is Black'
Mirror mirror on the wall,
Shovel chestnuts in my path
Please keep on up with the nuts
So I don't get in aftermath
But if I do I'll calmly punch them
In the fourth day of July
'Cause they tried to mess with

A puzzle made of pieces you can't find
But for me you never really had the time
I was blind, oooohhh.

And everything that you meant to me
Is written in the pages of my history
But it's over now as far as I can see
Suddenly

Things are so different now you're gone
I thought it'd be easy I was wrong
(and now I'm caught..)
And now I'm caught in the middle
Even though I'm with someone new
All I can think about is you
(and now I'm caught...)
And now I'm caught in the middle

Movin' on she brings me brighter days
Thoughts of you are in my mind always
Like a memory, that I can't erase
It's here to stay

Things are so different now you're gone
I thought it'd be easy I was wrong

And now I'm caught in the middle
Even though I'm with someone new

Locked up, they won't let me out
And I had a long day in court, shit stress me out
Won't give me a bill, they can't get me out
Now I'm headin to the County, gotta do a bid here
I used to livin luxurious, I don't wanna live here
The walls is gray, the clothes is orange
The phones is broke, the food is garbage
Lotta niggaz is livin with these circumstances
S.P.'s the same, I still merk ya mans-es
Drug money to rap money, work advances
Niggaz ran and told, I shoulda merked to Kansas
Got popped for a murder attempt
Knock me on D-Block when I was burnin the hemp
Had a brick in the stash
Hope they don't take it to a further extent
Locked up and they won't let me out
When I hit my cellblock, niggaz know the dread be out

[Akon]

I'm steady tryin to find a motive, why do what I do?
The freedom ain't gettin no closer, no matter how far I go
My car is stolen - no registration
The cops patrollin - and now they done stopped me
And I get locked up

[Chorus: Akon]

They won't let me out
They won't let me out
I'm locked up; they won't let me out, nooo
They won't let me out
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
They won't let me out
I'm locked up, they won't let me out, nooo
They won't let me out

[Akon]

Headin up town to re-up, back with a couple ki's
The corner block's on fire, undercovers dressed as fiends
Makin so much money - product's movin fast
Put away the stash - as I sold the last bag
Fucked around and got locked up

[Chorus]

[Styles P.]

Now that I'm locked up I rep two sets so
I'ma +Ryde or Die+ and stay D-Blocked up
Two toothbrushes up, whoever want it with P
When I walk by, nigga get up
Cause I'm locked up, they can't get me out
I smoke a stick of haze when they stress me out
Go and hit the bar when the wrecks be out
Can't wait for the day when they let me out

[Akon]

Cause visitation no longer comes by
It seems like they forgot about me
Commissary is gettin empty
My cellmates gettin food without me
I can't wait to get out and move forward with my life
(Move on with my life)
Got a family that loves me and wants me to do right
But instead I'm here locked up

[Chorus w/ variations + ad libs]

[Outro over Chorus - repeat to fade]

Cause I'm locked up
Where's my lawyer
.. Get me out of here
Baby I'm locked up
Where's my niggaz on the block
Tell them I'm locked up
I'm locked up
.. Can you please accept my phone call"

And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Coulda sworn I was dreamin for her

And when he dances down to the beat
I really think that he should know
That his rhythms go, go, go

I got a man with two left feet
And when he dances down to the beat
I really think that he should know
That his rhythms go, go, go

Does he wash up? Never wash up
Does he clean up? No, he never cleans up
Does he brush up? Never brushed up
He does nothing the boy does nothing

Does he wash up? Never wash up
Does he clean up? No, he never cleans up
Does he brush up? Never brushed up

Hey boy how you been?
I got a thousand lines
Where do I begin?
And I, I been here, been there
Traveling
I saw you at the corner
My vibe kicked in

And
Two fields
I clock you
Wearing tight jeans
A real nice suit
He was smiling like you
Was just seventeen
I asked him for a dance
He said “yes please”

Take a sip of dancing juice
Everybody’s onto you
Through the left and to the right
Everybody hit the rhythm
It’s on tonight
I’m gonna feel the heat within my soul
I need a man to take control
Let the melody blow you all away

Does he wash up? Never wash up
Does he clean up? No, he never cleans up
Does he brush up? Never brushed up
He does nothing the boy does nothing

Does he wash up? Never wash up
Does he clean up? No, he never cleans up
Does he brush up? Never brushed up
He does nothing the boy does nothing

Work it out now
Work it, Work it out now

Do the mambo
Shake it all around now

Everybody on the floor
Let me see you clap your hands

I wanna see you work
I wanna see you move your body in turn
I wanna see you shake your hips and learn

I wanna see you work it, work it, work it out now

I wanna see you work
I wanna see you move your body in turn
I wanna see you shake your hips and learn

I wanna see you work it, work it, work it out now

Does he wash up? Never wash up
Does he clean up? No, he never cleans up
Does he brush up? Never brushed up
He does nothing the boy does nothing

Does he wash up? Never wash up
Does he clean up? No, he never cleans up
Does he brush up? Never brushed up

And if the man can’t dance, he gets no second chance
And if the man can’t dance, he gets no second chance
And if the man can’t dance, he gets no second chance
And if the man can’t dance, he gets no second chance
And if the man can’t dance, he gets no second chance

But they're straight up fun for me

Waiting for you

And explaining to me like I was some kind of a fool
I sacrifice the things I want just to do things for you
But when it's time to do for me
You never come through

What's that number for b go-a-go-a-gone

Lord knows it wasn't easy believe me
Never thought you'd be the one that would deceive me
And never do what your suppose to do
No need to punch me boo cause I won't play you cause

What goes up most come down

Gotta stop trying to come back to me

My heart can't take no more lies,
and my eyes are all out of cries
soooo......God

repeat chorus

Now you had me on my knees
Begging God please
to send you back to me
I couldn't eat
I couldn't sleep
You even made me feel like I could not breathe
when I...all I wanted to do
was feel your touch
and to give you all of my love
but you took my love for granted
want my lovin now
but you cant have it
Oh God!

repeat chorus

Ohhhh God!

Send me an Angel (send me an angel)
An Angel!
Wipe the tears from my eyes
God send me an Angel from the Heavens above
Sent me an Angel (to heal my broken heart)
God send me an Angel
from being in love
send me (an Angel)
ohh God!
send me an Angel
send me (an Angel)

Oh, been trying to let it go
Trying to keep my eyes closed

Kept his dick wet
With his same old safe bet
Me and my head high
And my tears dry
Get on without my guy
You went back to what you knew
So far removed from all that we went through
And I tread a troubled track
My odds are stacked
I'll go back to black

We only said good-bye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to

I go back to earth
I love you much
It's not enough
You love blow and I love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside

We only said good-bye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to

We only said good-bye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to

Black, black, black, black, black, black, black
I go back to
I go back to

We only said good-bye with words
I died a hundred times

I’d rather be at home with Ray
I ain’t got seventy days
'Cause there’s nothing, nothing you can teach me
That I can’t learn from Mr. Hathaway

The man said why you think you here?
I said I got no idea
I’m gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near
He said I just think you’re depressed
This me, yeah baby, and the rest

They tried to make me go to rehab but I said no, no, no
Yes I been black but when I come back you'll know, know know

I don’t ever want to drink again
I just, ooh I just need a friend
I’m not gonna spend ten weeks
And have everyone think I'm on the mend

And it’s not just my pride
It’s just 'til these tears have dried

101,1982.0,Amy Winehouse,You Know I'm No Good,"Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say, ""What did you do it with him today?""
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray

Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you, I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Upstairs in bed with my ex boy, He’s in the place but I can't get joy
Thinking of you in the final throes, This is when my buzzer goes
Run out to meet you, chips and Pita; You say ""When we're married"" cause you're not bitter
There'll be none of him no more, I cried for you on the kitchen floor

[Chorus]

Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain; We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, You on the seat; Lick your lips as I soak my feet
Then you notice little carpet burn, My stomach drops and my guts churn
You shrug and it's the worst to truly stuck the knife in first

I cheated myself like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble, you know that I'm no good
I cheated myself, like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble, yeah, You know that I'm no good"

for you to bring a fairytale my way
Been living in a fantasy without meaning
It's not ok, i dont feel safe

I dont feel safe (oooh)

Left Broken, empty and in despair
Wanna breathe, can't find air
Thought you were sent from up above
But you and me never had love
so much more i have to say
help me find a way

And i wonder if you know
how it really feels,
to be left outside alone
when it's cold out here
Well maybe you should know
just how it feels
to be left outside alone
to be left outside alone

I tell you,

All my life i've been waiting
for you to bring a fairytale my way
Been living in a fantasy without meaning
It's not ok, i dont feel safe

I need to pray..

Why do you play me like a game?
Always someone else to blame
careless, helpless little man
someday i might understand
Theres not much more to say
but i hope you find a way

Still i wonder if you know, how it really feels
to be left outside alone, when its cold out here
well maybe you should know, just how it feels,
to be left outside alone
to be left outside alone

I tell you,

All my life i've been waiting
for you to bring a fairytale my way
Been living in a fantasy without meaning
It's not ok, i dont feel safe

I need to pray..
Ooh Pray
Heavenly father (oooh)

Oooooh..

And I Wonder If you know
How it really feels
To be left outside alone

[Angie M] Uh, woo! come on, uh
[Lil' Mo] If I can go, with you
[Angie M] Yo, yo, uh

[Verse 1: Angie Martinez]
If I can chose a place to go it gotta be far away
From here we could crossover like Hardaway
Somewhere outside the states where tommorow's like today
And I'm out in a space where nobody else can stay
And, if I can go, with you
Then I'll go get the ticket right now if that's cool
Have you ever been close to feelin like leavin the coast too
Feelin like leavin with somebody who
Hold you the right way while watchin the night fade
Make you feel like you right back in the ninth grade
When you know what he likes and what he might say
And you try to be calm and answer in nice ways
And, if I can go, with you
Way out the states no 2 ways and no page
No cells and no trace, and you just a phone call away
So all I got to say is

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

[Verse 2: Sacario]
And, if I can go, with you
Oh boy we 'bout to make a lot of people annoyed
And cry you better know I know how to sneak with them toys
And boy with the block since around 94 boy
And, if I can flow, with you
Huggin Tato after the studio I roll with you
I send Dutch and three other goons to go get you
Sacario the name hold weights the whole issue
Grown men keep on cryin get mo' tissue
The way me and this girl be rhymin it's so official
Them I'm takin a trip too with no pistols
Cause everything peace only sand no streets
Little Miami Heat that's the plan we'll see
Two cups, one in Senado one in Sand Beach
And, I'll think I'll go, with you
So tell the station you need a week back to you

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

[Bridge: Lil' Mo]
You can fly away, no one has to know
Will you take me with you, cause if I can go
Soon as you say the word, we'll be on our way
To a foreign place, you got to tell me

[Martinez Angie]
Yo, uh, so now that we got a plan are you comin? We could plan a week
The only question now is LaGuardia or Kennedy?

[Sacario]
And a seat, know why? the window cause I like to see
And seein as to how I'm so fly me and the clouds can speak

[Angie+S]
And, since we 'bout to go, in a few

But ain't no problems, unless the water don't stay blue

[Sacario]
And the shop's there?

[Martinez Angie]
If they don't got em, they don't make em

([Sacario:] True!)
No concrete just sand, throw away your shoes
Now, that we are on, our way
And our bags is packed and the car service is not late
Everything's ok, so I guess I catch you on the next track
Now I don't gotta ask

There's not a net you couldn't slip through

'Cause you're smooth and you're wet
And she's not aware yet but she's yours

She'll be sayin' ""Use me""
""Show me the jacuzzi""
I imagine that it's there on a plate
Your whole rendezvous rate means that
You'll never be frightened to make them wait for a while
I doubt it's your style
Not to get what you set out to acquire
The eyes are on fire
You are the unforecasted storm

""Come here, kid, we really need to talk""?
Bear with me, man, I lost my train of thought

I fantasize, I call it quits
I swim with the economists
And I get to the bottom of it for good
By the time reality hits
The chimes of freedom fell to bits
The shining city on the fritz
They come out of the cracks
Thirsty for blood

Just as the apocalypse finally gets prioritized
And you cried some of the hottest tears you ever cried
Multiplied by five

Just give him half a chance
I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes,
That he's got a driving ban
Amongst some other offences

And I've seen him with girls of the night
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light
They're all infected but he'll be alright
Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know
I said he's a scumbag, don't you know!

Although you're trying not to listen
Avert your eyes and staring at the ground
She makes a subtle proposition
“I'm sorry love I'll have to turn you down”

He must be up to summat
What are the chances sure it’s more than likely
I've got a feeling in my stomach
I start to wonder what his story might be, what his story might be

They said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here

Look here comes a Ford Mondeo
Isn't he Mister Inconspicuous?
And he don't have to say 'owt
She’s in the stance ready to get picked up

Bet she's delighted when she sees him
Pulling in and giving her the eye
Because she must be fucking freezing
Scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
It don't stop in the winter, no

They said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here
They said it changes when the sun goes down
Over the river going out of town
They said it changes when the sun goes down

What love will make you do
All the things that we accept
Be the things that we regret
To all of my ladies (ladies)
Feel me
C'mon sing with me:

See, when I get the strength to leave
You always tell me that you need me
And I'm weak cause I believe you
And I'm mad because I love you
So I stop and think that maybe
You can learn to appreciate me
Then it all remains the same that
You ain't never gonna change
(never gonna change, never gonna change)

(Chorus)

Baby,
Why you hurt me?
Leave me and desert me
Boy, I gave you all my heart
And all you did was tear it up
Looking out my window
Knowing that I should go
Even when I pack my bags
This something always hold me back"

(Cause I ain't goin out like a sucker, no way
I'm nice right now, I, I feel good
If you have a drink, would you please put it in the air)

That party last night was awfully crazy I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three, wake up at 10
Go out to eat, then do it again, man I love college..

I wanna go to college for the rest of my life
Sip banker's club, and drink Miller Lite
On Thursty Thursday and Tuesday Night Ice
And I can get pizza a dollar a slice
So fill up my cup
Lets get fucked up (lets get fucked UP!)
I'm next on the table,
Who want what? (What?!)
I am champion, at beer pong,
Allen iverson hakeem olajuwon
Don't even bounce, not in my house
Better hope you make it otherwise you naked
Time isnt wasted when youre getting wasted
Woke up today and all I could say is, um

That party last night was awfully crazy I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three wake up at 10
Go out to eat, then do it again
Man I love college (hey!)
And I love drinking
And I love women
Man I love college

I can't tell you what I learned from school,
But (nah) I could tell you a story or two, um
Yeah of course I learned some rules
Like dont pass out with your shoes on (get the sharpie!)
And dont leave the house til the booze gone
And dont have sex if shes too gone
When it comes to condoms, put two on (trust me)
And tomorrow night, find a new joint
Hold the beer bong, nothing wrong with some fun
Even if we did get a little bit too drunk
Time isnt wasted when youre getting wasted
Woke up today and all I can say is

That party last night was awfully crazy I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three wake up at 10
Go out to eat, then do it again
Man I love college
And I love drinking
And I love women
I love college

Now, if everyboyd would please put their drink
As high as they can, as high as they can
And repeat after me:

Chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug
Freshman freshman freshman freshman
Do somethin crazy! Do somethin crazy! Do somethin crazy! Do somethin crazy!
Keg stand Keg stand Keg stand Keg stand

That party last night

THat party last night

Alright everybody, I gotta head back to class for a little bit

I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed (youre all invited)
But my good friends is all I need (bring your friends)
Pass out at three wake up at 10
Go out to eat, then do it again

And by Wednesday I can't sleep
Then the phone rings I hear you
In the darkness is a clear view
Cause you've come to rescue me

Fall, with you I fall so fast
I can hardly catch my breath
I hope it lasts

Oh!
It seems like I can finally
Rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
Oh!
It's as if you know me better
Than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tear
Up the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

I am moody, I'm messy
I get restless and it's senseless
How you never seem to care

When I'm angry, you listen
Make me happy, it's your mission
And you won't stop till I'm there

Fall, sometimes I fall so fast
When I hit that bottom crash
You're all I have

Oh!
It seems like I can finally
Rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
Oh!
It's as if you know me better
Than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tear
Up the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

How do you know
Everything I'm about to say
Am I that obvious?
And if it's written on my face
I hope it never goes away

Yeah

On a Monday I am waiting
By Tuesday I am fading
Into your arms
So I can breathe

Oh!
It seems like I can finally
Rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels

Afternoon
In a room full of emptiness
By a freeway
I confess I was lost in the pages
Of a book
Full of death
Reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good we'll lay to rest
Anywhere we want to go

In your house
I long to be
Room by room
Patiently
I'll wait for you there
Like a stone
I'll wait for you there
Alone

And on my death bed
I will pray
To the gods and the angels
Like a pagan
To anyone who will take me to heaven
To a place
I recall
I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised
The wine was bled
And there you led me on

In your house
I long to be
Room by room
Patiently
I'll wait for you there
Like a stone
I'll wait for you there
Alone
Alone

And on i read
Till the day was gone
And i sat in regret
For all the things I've done
For all that I've blessed
And all that I've wronged
In dreams until my death
I will wander on

In your house
I long to be
Room by room
Patiently
I'll wait for you there
Like a stone
I'll wait for you there

You will see

Somebody else round everyone else
You're watching your back, like you can't relax
You're trying to be cool, you look like a fool to me
Tell me

Why you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else gets me frustrated
Life's like this you
And You fall and you crawl and you break
And you take what you get and you turn it into honesty

162,449.0,Avril Lavigne,Don't Tell Me,"You held my hand and walked me home, I know
Why you gave me that kiss,
It was something like this, and made me go oh oh.
You wiped my tears, got rid of all my fears,
Why did you have to go?
Guess it wasn't enough, to take up some of my love.
Guys are so hard to trust.

Did I not tell you that I'm not like that
Girl the one who, who gives it all away.

Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you? (This time)
Did you think that it was something i was gonna do? (And cry)
Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way

Don't think that your charm
And the fact that your arm is now around my neck
Will get you in my pants,
I'll have to kick your ass
To make you never forget.

I'm gonna ask to you stop,
I thought I liked you alot,
But I'm really upset (really upset)
So get outta my head,
Get off of my bed,
Yeah, that's what I said!

Did I not tell you that I'm not like that?
Girl the one who, who throws it all away.

Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you? (This time)
Did you think that it was something i was gonna do? (And cry)
Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way

This guilt trip that you put me on
Won't mess me up, I've done no wrong
Any thoughts of you and me have gone away

Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you? (This time)
Did you think that it was something i was gonna do? (And cry)
Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say

Hey hey, you you, I don't like your girlfriend
No way, No way, I think you need a new one
Hey hey, you you, I could be your girlfriend

Hey hey, you you, I know that you like me
No way, No way, no it's not a secret
Hey hey, you you, I want to be your girlfriend

You're so fine, I want you mine, You're so delicious
I think about you all the time, You're so addictive
Don't you know what I can do to make you feel all right?

Don't pretend, I think you know I'm damn precious
And hell yeah, I'm the mother fucking princess
I can tell you like me too, and you know I'm right

She's like, so whatever
You can do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that's what everyone's talking about

[Chorus]

I can see the way, I see the way you look at me
And even when you look away, I know you think of me
I know you talk about me all the time again and again (and again, and again, and again)

So come over here and tell me what I wanna hear
Or better, yet, make your girlfriend disappear
I don't wanna hear you say her name ever again (and again, and again, and again)

Because...

She's like so whatever
You can do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that's what everyone's talking about

In a second you'll be wrapped around my finger
'Cause I can, 'cause I can do it better
There's no other, so when's it gonna sink in
She's so stupid, what the hell were you thinking?

oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...

Let's talk this over
It's not like we're dead
Was it something I did?
Was it something you said?

Don't leave me hangin'
In a city so dead
Held up so high
On such a breakable thread

You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be

CHORUS
You were everything, everything that I wanted
We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it
And all of our memories, so close to me, just fade away
All this time you were pretending
So much for my happy ending
So much for my happy ending

You've got your dumb friends
I know what they say
They tell you I'm difficult
But so are they
But they don't know me
Do they even know you?
All the things you hide from me
All the shit that you do

You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be

CHORUS

It's nice to know that you were there
Thanks for acting like you cared
And making me feel like I was the only one
It's nice to know we had it all
Thanks for watching as I fall
And letting me know we were done

So much for my happy ending

Why she felt that way
She felt it every day
I couldn't help her
I just watched her make
The same mistakes again

What's wrong, what's wrong now
Too many, too many problems
Don't know where she belongs
Where she belongs

She wants to go home but nobody's home
That's where she lies
Broken inside.
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes,
Broken inside.

Open your eyes (open your eyes)
And look outside
Find the reason why (why)
You've been rejected (you've been rejected)
And now you can't find
What you left behind

Be strong, be strong now
Too many too many problems
Don't know where she belongs, where she belongs

She wants to go home but nobody's home
That's where she lies
Broken inside.
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes,
Broken inside.

Her feeling she hides
Her dreams she can't find
She's losing her mind
She's fallen behind
She can't find her place
She's losing her faith
She's fallen from grace
She's all over the place (yeah!)

She wants to go home but nobody's home
That's where she lies
Broken inside.
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes,
Broken inside.

She's lost inside, lost inside"

Can I make it anymore obvious?
He was a punk, she did ballet
What more can I say?
He wanted her, she'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends, stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes...

He was a skater boy
She said, ""See ya later, boy""
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face
But her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth

Five years from now, she sits at home
Feeding the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV and guess who she sees
Skater boy rocking on MTV
She calls up her friends, they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along, stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

He was a skater boy
She said, ""See ya later, boy""
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar
Slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

Sorry, girl, but you missed out
Well tough luck that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see
See the man that boy could be
There is more than meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside

He's just a boy and I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
We are in love, haven't you heard
How we rock each others world?!!

I'm with the skater boy
I said, ""See ya later, boy
I'll be backstage after the show
I'll be at the studio
Singing the song we wrote
About a girl you used to know.""

I don't have much to say
Daylight sneakin' through the window
And I'm still in this all-night cafe
Walkin' to and fro beneath the moon
Out to where the trucks are rollin' slow
To sit down on this bank of sand
And watch the river flow

Wish I was back in the city
Instead of this old bank of sand
With the sun beating down over the chimney tops
And the one I love so close at hand
If I had wings and I could fly
I know where I would go
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly
And watch the river flow

People disagreeing on all just about everything, yeah
Makes you stop and all wonder why
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street
Who just couldn't help but cry
Oh, this ol' river keeps on rollin', though
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And as long as it does I'll just sit here
And watch the river flow

People disagreeing everywhere you look
Makes you wanna stop and read a book
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street
That was really shook

Everything I do
Is for you
So what is it that you can't see
Sometimes I wish I could
Turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could
So bad, baby you'd better quit playing games with my heart

Chorus
Quit playing games with my heart
Before you tear us apart (with my heart)
Quit playing games with my heart
I should've know from the start
You know you've gotta stop (from my heart)
You're tearing us apart (my heart)
Quit playing games with my heart

Quit playing games
Baby, baby
The love that we had was so strong
Don't leave hangin' here forever
Oh baby, baby this is not a lie
Let's stop this tonight

Baby, ohh, quit playing games
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah baby
Nah nah nah nah

Sometimes I wish I could
Turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could
So bad baby
Quit playing games with my heart

Chorus
Quit playing games with my heart
Before you tear us apart (with my heart)
Quit playing games with my heart
I should've know from the start
You know you've gotta stop (from my heart)
You're tearing us apart (my heart)
Quit playing games with my heart
Quit playing games
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah baby

So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me, and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I can feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me...

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why, I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze if only...
Guilty roads to an endless love
(Endless love)
There's no control
Are you with me now
Your every wish will be done
They tell me...

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
(Tell me why)
Tell me why, I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

There's nowhere to run
I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be you're asking me to feel the things you never show

You are missing in my heart
Tell me why I can't be there where you are

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
(Tell me why)
Tell me why, I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Show me the meaning of being lonely
(Being lonely)
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why, I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart"

190,1090.0,Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,Where the Wild Roses Grow (feat. Kylie Minogue),"They call me The Wild Rose
But my name was Elisa Day
Why they call me it I do not know
For my name was Elisa Day

From the first day I saw her I knew she was the one
As she stared at my eyes and smiled
For her lips were the colour of the roses
That grew down the river, all bloody and wild

When he knocked on my door and entered the room
My trembling subsided in his sure embrace
He would be my first man, and with a careful hand
He wiped at the tears that ran down my face

Chorus

On the second day I brought her a flower
She was more beautiful than any woman I'd seen
I said, ""Do you know where the wild roses grow
So sweet and scarlet and free?""

On the second day he came with a single red rose
He said: ""Will you give me your loss and your sorrow?""
I nodded my head, as I lay on the bed
""If I show you the roses will you follow?""

Chorus

On the third day he took me to the river
He showed me the roses and we kissed
And the last thing I heard was a muttered word
As he knelt above me with a rock in his fist

On the last day I took her where the wild roses grow
And she lay on the bank, the wind lied as a thief
As I kissed her goodbye, I said, ""All beauty must die""
And lent down and planted a rose between her teeth

[Verse 2 - Beyonce]
When I talk to my friends so quietly,
Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me,
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress,
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress,
The way that you know what I thought I knew,
It's the beat my heart skips when I'm with you,
But I still don't understand,
Just how the love your doing no one else can.

[Chorus - Beyonce]
Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (oh crazy)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch (you're in love)
Got me looking so crazy right now (love!)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss (hey!)
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's, (hey)
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love.

I'm Looking so crazy in love's,
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love.

Well baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
Woah...

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me to the ground again

Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face

215,819.0,Beyoncé,Baby Boy (feat. Sean Paul),"If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home (to come home)
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong
But you're just a boy
You don't understand (Yeah, you don't understand)
How it feels to love a girl someday
You wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you're just a boy"

But could you walk and talk at the same time, and
It's my name that's on that Jag
So go move your bags, let me call you a cab

So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet ya thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
Because you was untrue
Rolling her around in the car that I bought you
Baby drop them keys

And workin from a 9 to 5,
just like a 5 dollar whore,
Knowin we're worth more,
We simply had to settle the score,
Thats why you see these albums and these singles in the store,
It's Big Brovaz baby,
Tryin to cash some major figures,
You mess with my cheese,
and I'll switch just like schwarzenegger.

[chorus]

This is big bro (bro)
Takin over the show (show)

Verse One: Notorious B.I.G.

When the lala hits ya lyrics just splits ya
Head so hard, that ya hat can't fit ya
Either I'm witcha or against ya
Format venture, back through that maze I sent ya
Talkin to the rap inventor
Nigga wit the game tight, Bic that flame right
Spell my name right, B-I, Double-G, I-E
Iced out lights out, me and Cease-a-Leo
Gettin head from some chick he know
See it's all about the cheddar, nobody do it better
Going back to Cali, strictly for the weather
Women, and the weed -- sticky green
No seeds bitch please, Poppa ain't soft
Dead up in the Hood, ain't no love lost
Got me mixed up, you drunk them licks up
Mad cause I got my dick sucked
and my balls licked, forfeit, the game is mine
I'ma spell my name one more time, check it
Its the, N-O, T-O, R-I, O
U-S, you just, lay down, slow
Recognize a real Don when you see Juan/one
Sippin on booze in the House of Blues

Chorus: repeat 4X

I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali

Verse Two: Notorious B.I.G.

If I got to choose a coast I got to choose the East
I live out there, so don't go there
But that don't mean a nigga can't rest in the West
See some nice breasts in the West
Smoke some nice sess in the West, y'all niggaz is a mess
Thinkin I'm gon stop, givin L.A. props
All I got is beef with those that violate me
I shall annihilate thee
Case closed, suitcase filled with clothes
Linens and things, I begin things
People start to flash, 818's, 213's
313's, B.I.G.
Frequently floss hoes at Roscoe's
If I wanna squirt her, take her to Fatburger
Spend about a week on Venice Beach
Sippin Crist-o, with some freaks from Frisco

Chorus

Verse Three: Notorious B.I.G.

Cali got gunplay, models on the runway
Scream Biggie Biggie gimme One More Chance
I be whippin on the freeway, the NYC way
On the celly-celly with my homeboy Lance
Pass hash from left to right
Only got five blunts left to light, I'm set tonight
Paid a visit to Versace stores
Bet she suck until I ain't got no more, only in L.A.
Bust on bitches be-lly, rub it in they tummy
Lick it, say it's yummy, then fuck yo' man
Fuck your plan, is it to rock the Tri-State?
Almost gold, 5 G's at show gate
Or do you wanna see about seven digits
Fuck hoes exquisite, Cali, great place to visit

Coppin a five-oh Benz for when I'm not, far up in the sky
Puffin the lye, from my Twinzito
Up in the Benzito with my Kiko from Queens, nicknamed perrico
We go back like PA's and wearin PJ's

Who wanna ride it won't cost you a dollar
whether soft or harder of course you still gonna holla
My my, I'm big huh, I rip my prick through your hooters
I'm sick, you couldn't measure my dick with six rulers
Hold up, chula, I'm all about gettin loot
But I knock that boot, if you out to get hoof

Chorus:
{Big Punisher}
I love from butter pecan to black berry molass'
I don't discriminate, I regulate every shade of the ass
Long as you show class, and pass my test
Fat ass and breasts, highly intelligent bachlorettes
That's the best, I won't settle for less
I wanna get a brunette, with unforgettable sex
I lay your head on my chest, come feel my heartbeat
We can park the Jeep, pump Mobb Deep, and just spark the leaf
It's hard to creep since I found Joe
Every pretty round brown hoe wanna go down low
But this Boogie Down pro-fessional, I'ma let you know
Once I quit the blows, get your clothes, cause you got to go
out the do' downstairs, little brown hairs everywhere
(You nasty Twin) I don't care
Round here they call me Big Pun, if you with the big guns
Take time, known to make a chick cum

{Joe and Big Punisher}
In the hot tub, poppin bubb-ly
Rubbin your spot love, got you screamin Punish me
But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked
When I stick even Luke be like ""Don't stop, get it get it""

You're a lucky guy when you consider
The highest bidder can't buy
The gleam in your eyes
You're a lucky guy
Thank you lucky stars
You've got a honey who wants no money
She'll take you just as you are
Thank you lucky stars
Hey fellow, say fellow
Don't you realise it's fated, you rated
Open up your eyes

You're lucky guy
You're just beginning so have your inning
And let your troubles boom by
No one can deny you're a lucky guy

Hey fellow, say fellow
Look at Mr. Jones
He's there and he's staring
Even he must know

You're a lucky guy
So why not treasure your highest pleasure
And live right up till you die
No one can deny boy
You're a lucky guy"

Just friends
Lovers no more
Just friends
But not like before
To think of what we've been
And not to kiss again
Seems like pretending
It isn't the ending
Two friends
Drifting apart
Two friends
But one broken heart
We loved we laughed we cried
Then suddenly love died
The story ends
And we're
Just friends
We loved we laughed and we cried
Then suddenly love died
The story ends
And we're
Just friends"

Will:
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
Hey, baby my nose is gettin' big
I noticed it be growin' when I be telling them fibs
Now you say your trust's getting weaker
Probably cause my lies just started gettin' deeper
And the reason for my confession is that I learned my lesson
And I really think you oughta know the truth
Because I lied and I cheated and I lied a little more
But after I did it I don't know what I did it for
I admit that I have been a little immature
Fuckin' wit your heart like I was the predator
In my book of lies I was the editor and the author
I forged my signature
And I apologize for what I did to you,
'Cause what you did to me I did to you

[Chorus]
No no no no baby, no no no no don't lie.
Cause you know know know, yeah you know know know you gotta try
What you gonna do when it all comes out
When they really see you 'n' what you're all about
No no no no baby, no no no no don't lie
Because you know you know you know you know you know you gotta try

APL:
She said I'm leaving
Cause she can't take the pain
It's hard to continue this love it ain't the same
Can't forget the things that I’ve done inside her brain
Too many lies committed too many games
She feeling like a fool getting on the last train
Tryin' to maintain but the feeling won't change
I'm sorry for the things that I've done and what I became
Caught up in living my life in the fast lane
Blinded by lights, cameras, you know the fame
I don't know the reason why I did these things
And I lie and I lie and I lie and I lie
And now her emotions are drained
Cause' I lie and I lie and a little lie lie
Now your emotions are drained

[Chorus]
No no no no baby, no no no nodon't lie
Cause you know know know, yeah you know know know know you gotta try
What you gonna do when it all comes out

And I lie and I lie and I lie till there's no turning back

i've tried
to live the way that you do
i've forgotten problems animosity enraging
foward futures doomed in my eyes
i was raped of my mind
control was never my possession
guided like a puppet on a thread
it was ready, ready to break
emotions stronger, stronger than ever before
burning inside my weakness counting the times
repetition starving
i'm racing against time
out of line i've had enough
i've suffered long enough
i'm wasting all my time
out of line i've had enough
i've suffered long enough
hey, if you hear me, listen to my words
i've taken just abou everything

Girl, me and you were just fine you know
We whine and dine
Did them things that couples do when in love you know
Walks on the beach and stuff you know
Things that lovers say and do
I love you boo, I love you too
I miss you a lot, I miss you even more
That's why I flew you out
When we was on tour
But then something got out of hand
You start yellin' when I'm with my friends
Even though I had legitimate reasons
You know I have to make them dividends
How could you trust our private lives girl
That's why you don't believe my lies
And quit this lecture

Kill it with the sound and

Guess that's the answer, 'cause take away women don't fail

People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?

Father, Father, Father help us

'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love (Love)

Where is the love (The love)
Where is the love (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love

It just ain't the same, always unchanged
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones
With the ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone
So I can ask myself really what is goin' wrong
In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug
If you never know truth then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all, come on (I don't know)
Where's the truth, y'all, come on (I don't know)
Where's the love, y'all( come on yeah)

Where is the love (Love)

Where is the love (The love)
Where is the love (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder
Most of us only care about money makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images, is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinemas
Yo', whatever happened to the values of humanity
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality
Instead in spreading love we're spreading animosity
Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive till love is found (now ask yourself)

Where is the love
Where is the love
Where is the love
Where is the love

Father, Father, Father help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'

So tell me what ya gonna do
When there ain’t nowhere to run
When judgement comes for you
When judgement comes for you
So tell me what ya gonna do
There ain‘t no place to hide
When judgement comes for you
Cos it‘s gonna come for you

[Chorus]
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads

So why you gotta go and pray
You’re gonna make it some day
You got a job
So why you want a raise
Why you wanna act tough
Why can’t you play
This whole fame thing
Just comes one of these days
And when it comes
You’ll be one of a kind
But before this
Keep all this in your mind
Cos I will hold you
To the end of the line
Want all this
You’ll be mad to decline

So what you gonna do
When everyday’s the same
Try and do this shush
Just for a glimpse of fame
Didn’t mean to do it
Just put yourself to shame
Didn’t want to kill her
Just tryin’ to play the game
When you reach the crossroads
Where you gonna go
Go with your conscience
Just let your feelings flow
Life’s up life’s down
But things can turn around
Innocent or guilty
You will soon be found

So what your gonna do when people hate you
chat beat you they dont like you,
cant run away coz they will find you,
praying for answers what you gonna do,

Decisions in life you have to make
which part of it you take its like dejavous
stand by ur side stand next 2 u
b there in the middle when ur passing thru,
in the middle meet u at the crossroads
between love and hate between good and evil
we can see u right thru where u told
the truth or a single lie
compared to the time when u made that man cry
dont wanna talk abt the day ur gonna die
soon or later that day will come
where you have to make the right or wrong decision,
which part of it u take, make good or bad,
just separate things, u wanna do that shhh try and resist
at the end of the day its up 2 u
il b there in the middle when ur passing thru!

Who’s that get off the train
Avirex jacket
With the poor with that rain
Why take that man’s chain
No more trouble made

Livin’ on the streets everyday
So lame
People walking past
Looking at you in shame
But they don’t really care
Who’s the one to blame
You’re gonna take the wrong turn
You’re gonna lose the game
You know its not you’re fault
That life turned this way
But people don't care
Don’t hear what you say
And the way it is now
Is the way it’s gonna stay
There’s no choice left but to hope and pray

[Breakdown]

(So you won’t be lonely)

See you, see you

I was beamin' in the beamer just beamin'
can't believe that I caught my man cheating
so I found another way to make him pay for it all
So I went to Neiman-Marcus on a shopping spree-ah
And on the way I grabbed Soley and Mia
And as the cash box rang I
thought everything away

when your man wants to get buck wild
just go back and hit 'em up style
put your hands on his cash and
spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
oh
when your cold and everything goes
from the crib, to the ride and the clothes
so you better let him know that
if he mess up
you gotta hit 'em up


While he was braggin
I was comin' down the hill uh just-a draggin'
all of his pictures and his clothes in the baggin
I sold eveything else til there was just nothing left
and I paid all the bills about a month too late
It's a shame we have to play these games
the love we had just faded away, away

All of the dreams you sold
left me out in the cold

To tell the truth you know I've been hurting all along,
Someway let me know, you want me girl.

Oh baby, you're the only thing that I really need,
baby that's why.

You make me wanna call you in the middle of the night,
You make me wanna hold you till the morning light,
You make me wanna love, you make me wanna fall,
You make me wanna surrender my soul.
I know this is a feeling that I just can't fight,
You're the first and last thing on my mind,
You make me wanna love, you make me wanna fall,
You make me wanna surrender my soul.

Well I know that these feelings won't end now,
They'll just get stronger if I see you again,
Baby I'm tired of being friends.
I wanna know if you feel the same,
And could you tell me do you feel my pain?
Don't leave me in doubt.

Everytime you see me what do you see?
I feel like I'm a poor man and you're the queen,

it aint my fault cuz I...
tried to get away but trouble follows me
and still I try so hard
hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
but until then, I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
but until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough

First, let me explain that I'm just a black man,
And I come from the darkside, so I'm havin a hard time stayin on track man,
My mind be racin', and I don't even know what I'm chasin yet
Been in and out of relationships, I'm startin to see that it's me where the complications at
But I'm layin back, prayin' that, you get that piece of mind of me
I thought I was right, but really I'm wrong, but again I was too blind to see,
I was in the fast lane chasin my dream,
And then it seemed when the fame and cash came, they just got me,
Goin crazyyyy, (lately, lately) lately I been so faded trying to erase it,
But I just can't cause the drama just grows greater,
And I been in so many collisions by puttin shit off till later.

It's like I'm takin five steps forward, and ten steps back
Tryin' get ahead of the game but I can't seem to get it on track
And I keep runnin away the ones that say they love me the most
How could I create the distance when it's supposed to be close? And uh,
I just don't know but I be out here fightin demons and
It's like the curse that I can't shake this part of Cleveland and
Lord, would you help me? And stop this pain
I keep inflinctin on my family (family)
Hustlin and gamblin, drinkin' and scramblin'

Throw your arms around me

Early morning, she wakes up with a
Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for makeup, perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for
They go...

Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?
And they say...

She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?

Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and
she keeps on winning
But tell me what happens when it stops?
They go...

She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?

Best actress, and the winner is...Lucky!
I'm Roger Johnson from Pop News standing outside
the arena waiting for Lucky!
Oh, my God...here she comes!

Isn't she lucky, this Hollywood girl?
She is so lucky, but why does she cry?
If there is nothing missing in her life

And I'm walking,

You can go just where she's going...

Need a little joy and some dancing,

I started wanting you again
There's just no way to hide from that old
Loving You feeling again
It's really got me reeling again
It only seems to stop to start all over again with you.

I remember how you'd always been
That certain look in your eyes
Your not easy to resist
But I just walked on by
With that loving old feeling again
It's really got me reeling again
Only seems to stop to start all over again with you
Loving you feeling with you
We were so close we were too far apart.

I gave you my love
I wanted your heart
Without yesterday haunting the way
Maybe we'd still be together
Sharing that loving you feeling again
It's really got me reeling again
Will it ever stop and not start over again

The fever we had migtha set the west coast on fire
Two months later got trouble in mind
My baby moved out and left me behind
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine

The way he left sure turned my head around
Seemed like overnight she just up and put me down


Ain't gonna let it bother me today
I been workin' and I'm too tired anyway
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine
I'm sixteen hundred miles from the people I know
Been doin' all I can but opportunity sure come slow
Lord I'd be in the sun all day
But I'm sweepin' out a warehouse in west L.A.

There's just no way to hide from that old
Loving You feeling again
It's really got me reeling again
It only seems to stop to start all over again with you.

I remember how you'd always been
That certain look in your eyes
Your not easy to resist
But I just walked on by
With that loving old feeling again
It's really got me reeling again
Only seems to stop to start all over again with you
Loving you feeling with you
We were so close we were too far apart.

I gave you my love
I wanted your heart
Without yesterday haunting the way
Maybe we'd still be together
Sharing that loving you feeling again
It's really got me reeling again
Will it ever stop and not start over again
That loving you feeling again
No matter how much I try
This loving you feeling
It's taken such a long time to say goodbye
And getting over you is so hard to do
With this feeling loving you
That loving you feeling again..."

Sweet dreams of you
Every night I go through
Why can't I forget you and start my life anew
Instead of having sweet dreams about you.

You don't love me, it's plain
I should have known you'll never wear my ring
I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you.

Sweet dreams of you
Things I know can't come true
Why can't I forget the past, start loving someone new
Instead of having sweet dreams about you..."

Love hurts, love scars, love wounds and mars
Any heart not tough or strong enough
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud holds a lot of rain
Love hurts, mmm, mmm, love hurts.

I'm young I know but even so
I know a thing or two I learned from you
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a stove burns you when it's hot
Love hurts, mmm, mmm, love hurts.

Some fools think of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
But they're not fooling me
I know it isn't true, know it isn't true
Love is just a lie made to make you blue
Love hurts, mmm, mmm, love hurts..."

Blowing up my head
Reaching for my always loving...

Soaking up my mind
Filling up my glass

Come on down to the creeps

Rock clean itself, so I pull in ladies

Roll a nigga tree, green leaves and all
Comin' up pretty deep, me and my dawg

Wanted by the six pound and I got heat, glock glock, shots to the block, we creep creep
Pop Pop hope cops don't see me, on a low key
With no regards for the law we dodge 'em like fuck 'em all
But I won't get caught up and brought up on charges for none of y'all

I'm only one call away

[Chingy]
It was weird how we met, huh
She was wit her mom in Bank America
I'm wit my son cashin the check
So I asked outta respect (uh)
Would she like to explore the world up high
We can fly in my jet
Her reply was Yes, can I ask you somethin'?
I seen it in her eye, mama lookin like all I wanted was sex
Then moved to the next (that ain't true) but it was something
About this girl's style that make me feel no regrets
We started off casual; walks through the park
Candle light dinners by dark, I'm thinkin smart (smart)
Afraid she might think I'm in a rush
To touch, crush and be up, but baby I ain't on that stuff
Dropped her off and told her call me up, we can talk
Conversate about political subjects whatever's thought
So I zoomed off, lookin by and my phone rang
It was her in the shower, (she said) she said I couldn't do without ya
Then I said. . .

[Chorus]

[Chingy]
The next day I'm with the fellas at the cage playing ball
Here she comes wit her friends they posted up on the wall
Now I'm showing off, tryna dunk tryna dribble break fast
Through the middle just to see her smile and giggle
Game over I approched her wit a kiss on the cheek
The homeboys lookin at me sayin Lil Howard you weak
But you know how that go, what I got they want
What I got I flaunt, never mess wit it, please don't
Told her I'm going home she asked can she go too
I'm like Yeah boo, I can't see me without you
Got thurr, I took a shower jumped out she in the bed
With a see-through thong said I looked at her and said. . .

[Chorus]

[Chingy]
Girl recognize game, before game recognize you
You're dealin wit a player, true
Now whatchu wanna do?
We can kick it and go puff on a bluuunt
Oh you don't smoke? Grab a pint of Hen' then we can get druuunk
It's up to you, I'm the man but baby just let me know
Cuz if you got an attitude I could treat you just like a hoe
Get to rollin wit me baby, hop in there's enough room
We can gaze at the stars that shine like the moon
Gimme a chance to show ya, and a chance to know ya
Just be true, and there's nothing I won't do, for ya
Some women like to play it foul (foul)
But them the kind I put in the place of a child (child)
Don't worry be happy and smile and. . .

She be shoppin at Frontenac, just look at her front and back
Man she's so stacked, and she know that I want that
Her man he so whack, girl can I taste your cat
Gave her 300 to strip, like buying a throwback
She stay in the club, like to be seen she got it honest
In real life, girl remind me of Pocahontas
She be at events, stop the press when she pass
All the high rollin' cats, wanna pay for that...
Ain't no half steppin', strapped with a nice weapon, trip
It's against the law for her to move them hips
If you ever seen her dirty, your mouth gone drop
World wide, fools probably tell you this off tops,

Twerkin in a phatty girl halter top
Then she backed it up on me, and let it drop (drop)
Make it hop (boing) , like a bunny (bunny)
Girl can I touch you where it's sunny
Her appearance will make you give her some money
She should pose for sports illustriated

A change is clearly taking place
Looking for the summer

The eyes take on a certain gaze
And leave behind the springtime days
Go looking for the summer

This ain't no game of kiss and tell
The implications how you KNEW so well
Go looking for the summer

The time has come and they must go
To play the passion out that haunts you so
Looking for the summer

Remember love how it was the same
We scratched and hurt each OTHER'S growing pains
We were looking for the summer

And still I stand this very day
With a burning wish to fly away
I'm still looking, looking for the summer"

Fuck y'all thought? Be dancin around in suits like I'm {Diddy}
Pretty, show niggaz how we run this city
Respect my name, Boogie nigga, stay in ya lane
Like The Hurricane, rains on bitches like Sugar Shane
And dare one of y'all rappin chicks to mention Fox name
""What's Beef?"" Beef is when bitches think it's sweet
See y'all frontin in the streets and let my gat meet ya

It's like I'm in my own fuckin world, I speak how I feel
Sometimes I feel like I'm just too fuckin real
I love to stack riches, no disrespect y'all
I respect the rap game, but I don't fuck with rap bitches
I'm speakin from my heart
It's not that I'm too good, I'm just hood
Been like this from the fuckin start
Since I bust my gun in ninety-six
Y'all never see me flick up with them fake-ass chicks
Bitches smile up in your face, turn around and pop shit
You a industry bitch, I'm a in the streets bitch
I might breeze through Prada, Chloe or Tiffs
But, other than that it's just me and my six

My moms and pops mixed it with the Trini' rum and whiskey
Uhh, proper set off
Six sped off, gats let off, I speak calm
Gangsta, and pours off like Screechie Don, bwoy
Who y'all know rock Prada like Fox
Pop bottles in the back of the cellar with Donatella
Cartier wrist wear, Pasha Kay face
Got niggaz stand in line just to get a sneak taste
Act like y'all don't know I keeps gat beneath waist
And like a hundred thou' each crib in each safe
When Fox come through she a go done de place
I'm like Marion Jones, what, who the FLUCK wan' race?
Listen, never trippin, never catch Brown slippin

I've got the roses and I've got the wine
With a little luck she will be here on time
This is the place we used to go
With romantic music and the lights down low
And as you stand there amazed at the door
And you're wondering what all this is for
It's just a simple thing from me to you
The lady that I adore
Cause there's something that you should know

It's that I've been missing you
More than words can say
And that I've been thinking about it every day
And the time we had just dancing nice and slow
And I said ""Now that I've found you
I'm never letting go""

There is no reason to the things that we do
You can break a heart with just a word or two
And take a lifetime to apologise
When the one you love's in front of your eyes
And I will fall to my knees like a fool
If it's the only way of getting through
You see if I think you are beautiful
Someone else is gonna feel it too
So there's only on thing to do

It's that I've been missing you
More than words can say
And that I've been thinking about it everyday
Well tonight's our night for dancing nice and slow
Because now I've found you
I'm never letting... go."

413,527.0,Christina Aguilera,Fighter,"After all you put me through
You'd think I'd despise you
But in the end I want to thank you
'Cause you made me that much stronger

Well I thought I knew you
Thinking that you were true
I guess I, I couldn't trust
Called your bluff time is up

'Cause I've had enough
You were there by my side
Always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame

After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that
I hold resentment for you
But, uh uh, oh no, you're wrong

'Cause if it wasn't for
All that you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable
I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you 'cause

It makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So, thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So, thanks for making me a fighter

Never saw it coming
All of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in
On a good thing before I realized your game

I heard you're going around
Playing the victim now
But don't even begin
Feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave

After all of the fights and the lies
Yes, you wanted to harm me
But that won't work anymore
Uh, no more, oh no, it's over

'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now
And never back down
So I wanna say thank you 'cause

It makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So, thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
It makes me that much smarter
So, thanks for making me a fighter

How could this man I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust so cruel
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth

You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself
Through living in denial
But in the end you'll see
You won't stop me

I am a fighter and I
I ain't gonna stop
There is no turning back
I've had enough

'Cause it makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So, thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
It makes me that much smarter
So, thanks for making me a fighter

You thought I would forget,
But, I, I remember
I remember, I remember
You thought I would forget,
But, I, I remember
I remember, I remember

'Cause it makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So, thanks for making me a fighter

Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
It makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter"

You're probably thinking that I want those things

But you don't know where I have been
I could be a wolf in disguise
I could be an angel in your eyes

On the corner rollin
Doin' my own thing

Up on this side of this mountain of mine

Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance that you get is a chance you seize
How long am I going to stand
With my head stuck under the sand
I'll start before I can stop

From the rooftops I remember
There was snow
White snow

Clearly I remember
From the windows they were watching
While we froze 
Down below

When the future's architectures
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low

If you love me
Won't you let me know?

Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And the fog
Became God

Priests clutched onto bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And the cross was held aloft

Bury me in armor
When I'm dead and hit the ground
A love back home unfolds

If you love me
Won't you let me know?

I don't want to be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship
Would stow, far below

So if you love me
Why did you let me go?

I took my love down to Violet Hill
There we sat in snow
All that time she was silent still

So if you love me
Won't you let me know?

If you love me,
Won't you let me know? "

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

What did she say? She said she'd love to
rendezvous
She asked me what we were gonna do
said we'd start with a bottle of moet for two

(Chorus)

Monday
took her for a drink on Tuesday
we were making love by Wednesday
and on Thursday & Friday & Saturday we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
took her for a drink on Tuesday
we were making love by Wednesday
and on Thursday & Friday & Saturday we chilled on Sunday

(Verse 2)

Nine was the time
cuz I'll be getting mine
and she was looking fine
Smooth talker
she told me
She'd love to unfold me all night long
Ooh I loved the way she kicked it
from the front to back she flipped it (back she flipped it, ooh the
way she
kicked)
And I oh oh I yeah
hope that she'd care
cuz I'm a man who'll always be there

Ooh yeah
I'm not a man to play around baby
Ooh yeah
cuz a one night stand isn't really fair
From the first impression girl hmm you don't seem to be like that
Cuz there's no need to chat for there'll be plenty time for that
From the subway to my home
endless ringing of my phone
When your feeling all alone
all you gotta do
is just call me call me

(Chorus)

Monday
took her for a drink on Tuesday
we were making love by Wednesday
and on Thursday & Friday & Saturday we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
took her for a drink on Tuesday
we were making love by Wednesday
and on Thursday & Friday & Saturday we chilled on Sunday

(Break it down, break it down)
Since I met this special lady
ooh yeah
I can't get her off my mind
She's one of a kind
And I ain't about to deny it
It's a special kind of thing
with you-oh.......

Chorus

Monday
took her for a drink on Tuesday
we were making love by Wednesday
and on Thursday & Friday & Saturday we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
took her for a drink on Tuesday
we were making love by Wednesday
and on Thursday & Friday & Saturday we chilled on Sunday, Sunday Sunday Sunday...."
454,439.0,David Bowie,Modern Love,"I don't want to go out
I wont stay in
Get things done

I catch a paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye

But I try, I try

There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
I'm lying in the rain
But I never wave bye-bye

But I try, I try

Never gonna fall for
Modern love - walks beside me
Modern love - walks on by
Modern love - gets me to the church on time
Church on time - terrifies me
Church on time - makes me party
Church on time - puts my trust in god and man
God and man - no confessions
God and man - no religion
God and man - don't believe in modern love

It's not really work
It's just the power to charm
I'm still standing in the wind
But I never wave bye bye

But I try, I try

Never gonna fall for
Modern love - walks beside me
Modern love - walks on by
Modern love - gets me to the church on time
Church on time - terrifies me
Church on time - makes me party
Church on time - puts my trust in god and man
God and man - no confessions
God and man - no religion
God and man - don't believe in modern love

Modern love, Modern love, Modern love, Modern love, Modern love, Modern love
Modern love, Modern love, Modern love, Modern love, Modern love, Modern love

Modern love, walks beside me
Modern love, walks on by
Modern love, walks beside me
Modern love, walks on by

Never gonna fall for
Never gonna fall for"
455,528.0,Craig David,Fill Me In,"I was checking this girl next door
When her parents went out she'd phone
Say 'hey boy, come on right around'
So I knock at the door, you were standing
With a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down, start kissing, caressing
Told be 'bout Jacuzzi, sounded interesting so we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone

I mean me and her parents were kind of cool
But they were the fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents trying to find out what we were up to
Saying why were you creeping 'round late last night
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light
Now you're dressed in black, when I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in
Calls diverted to answer phone, red wine bottle half the contents gone
Midnight return, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in

Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say 'hey girl, come on right around'
So she knocked at the door, I was standing
With the keys in my hand to the 4x4, jumped in my ride
Checking that nobody saw
The club we went in, we got down bounce, bounce to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning, thought we'd better be leaving
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cos you felt cold

I mean me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents trying to find out what we were up to
Saying why can't you keep your promises no more
Saying you'll be home by 12, come strolling in at 4
Out with the girls, but leaving with the boy next door
Can you fill me in
Wearing a jacket who's property, said you'd been queuing for a Taxi
But you left all your money on the TV
Can you fill me in

All they seem to do, is be checking up on you, baby
Watching your every move
Think some day, they might approve, baby..........

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Oh I'm not listenin'
oh I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
And I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself
what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist
but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, (Like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan, to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here (Ooh)
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
Oh tell them I'll be here
(Ooh) right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself
what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here Here (Oh oh, oh oh)"

Come, come, my lady.
You're my butterfly,
Sugar baby.
Come, my lady.
Come, come, my lady.
You're my butterfly,
Sugar baby,

Such a sexy, sexy, pretty little thing.
Fierce nipple pierce...
You got me sprung with your tongue ring,
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high.
So, to keep you by my side,
There's nothing that I won't try.
Butterflies in her eyes and the looks to kill...
Time is passing. I'm asking, ""Could this be real,""
'Cause I can't sleep. I can't hold still.
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal I can feel.
Too much is never enough.
You're always there to lift me up
When these times get rough.
I was lost. Now I'm found.
Ever since you've been around...
You're the women that I want,
So, yo, I'm putting it down.

Come, my lady.
Come, come, my lady.
You're my butterfly,
Sugar baby.
Come, my lady.
You're my pretty baby.
I'll make your legs shake.
You make me go crazy.
Come, my lady.
Come, come, my lady.
You're my butterfly,
Sugar baby.
Come, my lady.
You're my pretty baby.
I'll make your legs shake.
You make me go crazy.

I don't deserve you
Unless it's some kind of hidden message
To show me life is precious.
Then I guess it's true.
But to tell the truth, I really never knew 'til I met you.
See, I was lost and confused,
Twisted and used up.
Knew a better life existed but thought that I missed it.
My lifestyle's wild.
I was living like a wild child,
Trapped on a short leash,
Parole. The police files...
So, yo, what's happening now?
I see the sun breaking down a few dark clouds
And a vision of you standing out in a crowd. So...

Come, my lady.
Come, come, my lady.
You're my butterfly,
Sugar baby.
Come, my lady.
You're my pretty baby.
I'll make your legs shake.
You make me go crazy.
Come, my lady.
Come, come, my lady.
You're my butterfly,
Sugar baby.
Come, my lady.
You're my pretty baby.
I'll make your legs shake.
You make me go crazy.

Hey, sugar momma, come and dance with me.
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me.
Whatever tickles your fancy...
Girl, it's me and you like Sid and Nancy.
So sexy, almost evil...
Talk about butterflies in my head.
I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read,
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead.
You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase,
And as far as I can see, it don't get better than this.
So, butterfly, here is a song,
And it's sealed with a kiss and a ""thank you, miss.""

Come and dance with me.
Come and dance with me.
Come and dance with me.
So, come and dance with me.
(Uh-huh, uh-huh.)

Come, my lady.
Come, come, my lady.
You're my butterfly,
Sugar baby.
Come, my lady.
You're my pretty baby.
I'll make your legs shake.
You make me go crazy.
Come, my lady.
Come, come, my lady.
You're my butterfly,
Sugar baby.
Come, my lady.
You're my pretty baby.
I'll make your legs shake.
You make me go crazy.
Come, my lady.
Come, come, my lady.
You're my butterfly,
Sugar baby.
Come, my lady.
You're my pretty baby.
I'll make your legs shake.
You make me go crazy.
Come, my lady.
Come, come, my lady.
You're my butterfly,
Sugar baby.
Come, my lady.
You're my pretty baby.
I'll make your legs shake.
You make me go crazy.

460,692.0,Creed,Higher,"When dreaming I'm guided to another world
Time and time again
At sunrise I fight to stay asleep
'Cause I don't want to leave the comfort of this place
'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape
From the life I live when I'm awake

So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask can we stay

Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets?

Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same
The only difference is
To let love replace all our hate

So let's go there
Let's make our escape
C'mon let's go there
Let's ask can we stay

Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see?
Can you take me higher?
to a place with golden streets?

So let's go there
Let's go there
C'mon let's go there
Let's ask can we stay

Up high I feel like I'm alive for the very first time
Sail up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams
And make them mine.

Sail up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams
And make them mine.

Of perfect love that you gave to me,
I remember.

When you are with me, I'm free,
I'm careless, I believe,
Above all the others, we'll fly,
This brings tears to my eyes.

We've seen our share of ups and downs,
Oh, how quickly life can turn around,
in an instant,
It feels so good to reunite,
Within yourself, and within your mind,
Let's find peace there.

I'm looking down now that it's over
Reflecting on all of my mistakes

Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun...

Where there was pain now there's joy
Where there was weakness, I found my strength

I don't know, dude ...
I think everybody's all jealous and shit
Cause, I'm like, the lead singer of a band, dude ...
And I think everyone's got a fuckin' problem with me, dude ...
And they need to take it up with me after the show
Because

(Chorus)
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

(Verse 1- Eminem)
So I get off stage right? and drop the mic
Walk up to the hot chicks and I'm all like
What's up ladies, my name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer in D12, baby
They're all like ""Oh my God, it's him
Becky, oh, my fuckin' God, it's Eminem
I swear to fuckin' God, dude, you fuckin' rock
Please won't you please let me suck your cock""
Now by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude, I just think you're trynna steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
Because I told him Jessica Alba's my wife-to-be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because these...

(Chorus)
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

My Band!
Baby yeah!

Swifty: Alright, ok, alright man, give me that mic man, ok, daw...gi...come on..
Eminem: Dude!
Swifty: Give me this mic!
Eminem: Ah, dude?

(Verse 2- Swifty)
You just wanna see a nigga backwards, don't you?
Hey dad how come we don't rap off Pro Tools?
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, yous a liar
And no, I'm Swift (""Oh, I thought you was Kuniva"")
What the hell is wrong with that dressing room?
Cause our shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, (uh-huh) it's simple but,
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intact, trynna get on the map
Doin' jumpin' jacks while get whipped on my back

(Verse 3- Kuniva and Kon Artis)
Kuniva: Look at Em little punkass thinkin' he the shit
Kon: Yeah, I know, man, by himself takin' on a flick
Kuniva: Hey, I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
Eminem: No I had an interview, not you two
Kuniva: You gonna be late for soundcheck
Kon: Man I ain't goin' to soundcheck
Kuniva: Man our mics are screwed up
Kon: And his always sound best.. You know what man I'ma say somethin'
Kuniva: Ay, yo, Em
Eminem: You got somethin' to say?!
Kon: Man, nothin'
Kuniva: I thought you 'bout to tell him off, man, what's up
Kon: Man I'ma tell him when I feel like and man shut up. And you ain't even back me up when we s'posed to be crew
Kuniva: Man, I was 'bout to talk right after you, I swear
Kon: Man, whatever!
Kuniva: I swear man

(Chorus)
These chicks don't even know the name of my band,
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands,
Cuz once I blow they know that I'll be the man,
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

(Verse 4- Proof)
They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Once we sold out arenas to amusement parks
How I'm gonna let the world know that Proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
(Eminem: Ay, yo what's....)
Ready to stap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear,
(""Hey dude, I love your band"")
We ain't a band, bitch, we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent
And these guys they can find every area code
(Eminem: Proof, carry my bag)
Bitch, carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
(""Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!"")

(Verse 5- Bizarre)
God dammit, I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
'Till Kon Artis slipped me some crack
Lose Yourself video, I was in the back
Superman video, I was in the back
For the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us some questions
Like ""Who's D12?"" ""How we get started?""
(""But what about Eminem?"")
Bitch, are you retarded?
Anyway, I'm the popularest guy in the group
Bigass stomach, bitches think I'm cute
(""Hey sexy"")
50 told me to do sit-ups to get buff
Did two and a half and then I couldn't get up (Uhh!)
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm gonna start a group with the real Roxanne

(Eminem)
Girl why can't you see you're the only one for me
And it just tears my ass apart to know that you don't know my name

(Chorus- Bizarre - {Bizarre also})
Man, fuck this
These chicks don't even know the name of my band (ha ha)
But they all on me like they wanna hold hands (Fuck Marshall)
Cause once I blow I know that I'll be the man (yeah)
All because I'm the lead singer......
My Band
My Band(The Band)
My Band(Our Band)
My Band(The Band)
My Band(You Man)
My Band(You Man)
My Band(Roxanne)
My Band(Shantan)
My Band(Lets do it)

(Outro)
The hottest boy band in the world....D12!

(Eminem)
I'm the lead singer of my band, I get all the girls to take off their underpants
I'm the lead singer of my band, my salsa
Makes all the pretty girls want to dance
My salsa(wooo ohhh), look out for my next single, it's called ""My Salsa""
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, my salsa
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants, my salsa
(Where'd everybody go?)"

[Eminem]
Ugh.. yo yo yo, yo

[Chorus: Eminem]
I've been so many places, I've seen so many faces
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple hills
I've climbed the highest mountain, once or twice but who's countin
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple hills

[Eminem]
Yo, yo
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of lawsuits inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people and five I hit (oops)
Aww [shit], I started a mosh pit
Squashed a chick and lost her foster kids (ahh!)
This room make me hallucinate
Then I sweat 'til I start losin weight
'Til I see dumb [shit] start happenin
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin to rap again
So bounce, bounce, come on bounce
{*GUNFIRE*} I said come on, bounce (ahh!)
Everybody in the house doin mass amounts (me!)
To the women in the thongs with they asses out (oh)
We don't bull[shit], better ask around
D-12 throws the bombest bash in town
Bizarre, your mom is crashin out
Help me get her on the couch 'fore she passes out
Come on!

[Kon Artis and Kuniva]
[Fuck] that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs wrestlin Elton John
Heh, hey Von you see me steppin on these leprechauns?
It gotta be Tums, the Exlaxe is gone
Ya I took them all dawg with some parmesan
And I think my arm is gone
Naw it's probably numb
Young, dumb, and full of [cum]
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
Scary ass it was a false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
Yo stop actin stupid
You so high that you might wake up with a guy on some new [shit] (eww!)
Yeah I think I did too much (uh-huh)
I think I got the runs (uh-huh)
Rolaids, Pepto and Tums -- watch out, here it comes! {*laughter*}

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Dirty Dozen, eighty of us, Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out and date each other
Some-, somethin, some'un, some'un, some'un {*babbling*}

[Proof]
Hop hills, hills I hop
Hop two hills on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought it was +Incredible+ and killed the +Hulk+
I wanna, roll away like a rollerblade
Until my eyes fall back and I'm scared for days
And when I'm, over weight and my golf ball broke
No okey-doke, I'm packin my nose with soap
{*cough cough cough*} Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Aww, poor baby, born by [whore] lady
Now I'm payin child support.. (it's your baby!)

[Swifty McVay]
I take fo' shots at one time
And I don't need a chaser when I'm swallowin' mine
(Hey, you got any room?) In Bizarre's hatchback?
We can't go far cause our car has flats
Why the hell you people think I rap?
Because my mother taught me how to breach contracts
And if you got cash, then hide it soon
(Swift, chill) I'm just tryin to get bi like you! (eww!)
And I don't give a damn if they find me rude (uh-huh)
Mean, crude, the hell with you too (uh-huh)
I only need three blunts and I'm cool
I just copped some and I'm goin back soon

[Chorus]

[Bizarre]
I'm at a rave lookin at a babe like she want it (hahaha)
Gin and tonic demonic, body smell like vomit
Loony, crazy, chunky, sexy, dopey-headed guy
Whip cream, dirty mattresses, wanna try? (c'mon)
Blue hills, golden seals, got Bizarre, actin ill
Drugs kill (yeah right) - chick, I'm for real!
Shut your mouth you dirty girl, you know you want me in your world
Ladies please don't fight; Bizarre's here all night!

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Dirty Dozen, eighty of us, Shady brothers, ladies love us

Take a little higher, I'm thinking of you,
Tell me what you're feeling,
I feel it with you.

We can only understand what we are shown,
How was I supposed to know our love would grow?

Move a little closer,
Be sure I'll pick it up,
Heal me with your loving,
I need you so much,
I need you so much,

I don't know why you're so far away
But I know that this much is true
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with
And I wish that you could be the one I die with
And I pray in you're the one I build my home with
I hope I love you all my life

I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?

'Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away
And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today
'Cause I love you, whether it's wrong or right
And though I can't be with you tonight
You know my heart is by your side

I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?"
483,128.0,Daniel Powter,Bad Day,"Where is the moment when we need it the most
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue sky's faded to grey
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carrying on

You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carrying on

Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Well you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carrying on

You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Sometimes the system goes on the blink and the whole thing it turns out
Wrong
You might not make it back and you know that you could be well oh that
Strong
Well I'm not wrong

So where is the passion when you need it the most
Oh you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
You see what you like
And how does it feel, one more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
You had a bad day"

It was a rush, what a rush

That you would ever feel the same way about me
It's just too much, just too much
Why do I keep running from the truth?
All I ever think about is you
You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized
And I've just got to know

Do you ever think when you're all alone
All that we can be, where this thing can go?
Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it real or just another crush?
Do you catch a breath when I look at you?
Are you holding back like the way I do?
'Cause I'm trying and trying to walk away
But I know this crush ain't goin' away-ay-ay-ay-ayy
Goin' away-ay-ay-ay-ayy

Has it ever crossed your mind
When we're hanging, spending time girl, are we just friends?
Is there more, is there more?

Last forever, forever

Esta noche no es normal
,Sucedió algo diferente,
fue tu vozMe toco, me cambio.

Una posibilidad,
De que sintieras lo mismo tu por mi,
Es mucho mas, mucho mas.
Para que negarme a la verdad,
Si ya no hago mas que en ti pensar
.Hipnotizado ya, no puedo mas,
Dime si esto es amor.

Si piensas en mi,
en tu soledad.
Lo que puede ser
, de nosotros dos
.Si estoy loco o enamorado.
O si es simplemente una ilusión.

Si suspiras tu,
si te miro yo
.Lo quieres negar,
como lo hago yo.
Porque ya no quiero pretender.
Lo que siento no lo puedo
esconder.No puedo esconder.


Dime si alguna vez,
Ha pasado por tu mente compartir
,Algo mas, que una Amistad.
Si es un riesgo que correr
Pero yo se que podemos hacerlo
Que esto durara,
Para siempre, por siempre.


Si piensas en mi,
en tu soledad.
Lo que puede ser, de nosotros dos
.Si estoy loco o enamorado.
O si es simplemente una ilusión.

Si suspiras tu, si te miro yo
.Lo quieres negar, como lo hago yo
.Porque ya no quiero pretender.
Lo que siento no lo puedo esconder.
No puedo esconder.
Para que negarme a la verdad,
Ya no hago mas que en ti pensar.
Hipnotizado ya, no puedo mas,
Dime si esto es amor.
Si piensas en mi, en tu soledad
.Lo que puede ser, de nosotros dos.
Si estoy loco o enamorado.
O si es simplemente una ilusión.
Si suspiras tu, si te miro yo.
Lo quieres negar, como lo hago yo.
Porque ya no quiero pretender.
Lo que siento no lo puedo esconder.
No puedo esconder.

489,1308.0,Björk & David Arnold,Play Dead,"darling stop confusing me
with your wishful thinking
hopeful enbraces
don't you understand?
i have to go through this
i belong to here where
no-one cares and no-one loves
no light no air to live in
a place called hate
the city of fear

i play dead
it stops the hurting
i play dead
and hurting stops

it's sometimes just like sleeping
curling up inside my private tortures
i nestle into pain
hug suffering
caress every ache

i play dead
it stops the hurting"

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Oh I'm not listenin'
oh I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
And I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself
what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist
but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, (Like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan, to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here (Ooh)
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends

Yeah, but no one just a stranger I did find
I never noticed, hadn't seen it as it grew
The void between us where the flame turns blue

Different places, yeah, but they all look the same
Dreams of faces in the streets devoured by names
I'm in collision with every stone I ever threw
And blind ambition where the flame turns blue

Words dismantled, hey, and all the books unbound
Conversations though we utter not a sound
I heard a rumour, I don't know if it's true
That you'd meet me where the flame turns blue

So I venture underneath the leaden sky
See the freight train with it's one fierce eye
And then I listen as it tears the night in two
With a whistle and the flame turns blue

In the morning I will sing
In the morning I will sing

Through the lemon trees, the diamonds of light
Break in splinters on the pages where I write
That if I lost you I don't know what I'd do
Burn forever where the flame turns blue
That if I lost you I don't know what I'd do
Burn forever where the flame turns blue

And I'm watching the cruisers below
He's down on the street
And he's trying hard to pull sister Flo
Oh, my heart's in the basement
My weekend's at an all time low
'Cause she's hoping to score
So I can't see her letting him go
Walk out of her heart
Walk out of her mind

She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

She's an old-time ambassador
Of sweet talking, night walking games
And she's known in the darkest clubs
For pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it
Then she can do it, she don't make false claims
But she's a Queen, and such are queens
That your laughter is sucked in their brains
Now she's leading him on
And she'll lay him right down
Yes she's leading him on
And she'll lay him right down
But it could have been me
Yes, it could have been me
Why didn't I say, why didn't I say, no, no, no

She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

So I lay down a while
And I gaze at my hotel wall
Oh the cot is so cold
It don't feel like no bed at all
Yeah I lay down a while
And I look at my hotel wall
But he's down on the street
So I throw both his bags down the hall
And I'm phoning a cab
'Cause my stomach feels small
There's a taste in my mouth
And it's no taste at all
It could have been me
Oh yeah, it could have been me
Why didn't I say, Why didn't I say, no, no, no

She's so swishy in her satin and tat

Saw these stars crashing

I'm a mess without my little China Girl
Wake up in the morning, where's my little China Girl
I hear her heart's beating loud as thunder
Saw these stars crashing down

I'm feeling tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China Girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China Girl

I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes

My little China Girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
You know;
I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you men who want to rule the world

514,1011.0,Delta Goodrem,Lost Without You,"I know I can be a little stubborn sometimes
A little righteous and too proud
I just want to find a way to compromise
Cos I believe that we can work things out

I thought I had all the answers
Never giving in
But baby since you've gone
I admit that I was wrong

CHORUS (1)
All I know is I'm lost without you
I'm not gonna lie
How am I gonna be strong without you
I need you by my side
If we ever said we'll never be together
and we ended with goodbye
Don't know what I'd do
I'm lost without you

CHORUS (2)
I keep trying to find my way
but all I know is
I'm lost without you
I keep trying to face the day
Lost without you

How am I ever gonna get rid of these blues?
Baby I'm so lonely all the time
Everywhere I go I get so confused
You're the only thing that's on my mind

Oh my bed so cold at night
And I miss you more each day
Only you can make it right
Though I'm not too proud to say

CHORUS (1)
All I know is I'm lost without you
I'm not gonna lie
How am I gonna be strong without you
I need you by my side
If we ever said we'll never be together
and we ended with goodbye
Don't know what I'd do
I'm lost without you

CHORUS (2)
I keep trying to find my way
but all I know is
I'm lost without you
I keep trying to face the day
Lost without you

If I could only hold you now
Make the pain just go away
Can't stop the tears from running down my face
(oh)

CHORUS (1)
All I know is I'm lost without you
I'm not gonna lie
How am I gonna be strong without you
I need you by my side
If we ever said we'll never be together
and we ended with goodbye
Don't know what I'd do
I'm lost without you

CHORUS (3)
I keep trying to find my way (yeah)
but all I know is
I'm lost without you
I keep trying to face the day
(but all I find is)I'm lost without your love

I keep trying to find my way
And all I know is
I'm lost without you (oh)

I'm lost without you"

But I Know Deep Inside He Don't Mean It
It Gets Hard Sometimes
But I Need My Man
I Don't Think Ya'll Understand
I'm Telling You

That tries to keep a man awake at night
Are you the answer I shouldn't wonder
When I can feel you whet my appetite
With all the power you're releasing
It isn't safe to walk the city streets alone
Anticipation is running through me
Let's find the keys and turn this engine on

I can feel you breathe
I can feel your heart beat faster.....

CHORUS:
Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen honey
Just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby..oh..ho..ohhhhh

I get frightened in all this darkness
I get nightmares I hate to sleep alone
I need some company a guardian angel
To keep me warm when the cold winds blow

I can feel you breathe
I can feel your heart beat faster.....faster

Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen honey
Just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby
Be my little baby..uh..huh

Just like Ronnie sang

Just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby
Baby my darlin'..uh..uh..oh..oh..ohhhh

539,1687.0,Dido,Thank You,"My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why
I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be grey,
but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad,
it's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay,
my head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today,
I'm late for work again
And even if I'm there, they'll all imply
that I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad,
it's not so bad and

I want to thank you
for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you
is having the best day of my life

Push the door, I'm home at last
and I'm soaking through and through
Then you hand me a towel
and all I see is you
And even if my house falls down now,
I wouldn't have a clue
because' you're near me and

I want to thank you
for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you
is having the best day of my life (bis)"

I've been keeping my eyes on your movements
I can't see no room for improvement
But why you all alone over there on your jack jones?
You need to let me get behind your backbones
Cus I'm the man for the job let me work it
I won't waste no time I'll make it worth it
100 percent, i'll make it perfect
you got a body to die for, let me merk it
Now it's murder on the dance floor
I want to take this further than the dance floor
I aint forcefield but I'm still hardcore
You're going to give me everything I ask for
It's not a long ting, you're a boomting
Maybe more than a hotel room ting
I'll never know if I just walk past
I really want to dance so I guess I'll just ask

She aint no oh
Look at those thighs, it's in her eyes she's good to go
She can satisfy my mind body and soul

Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come dance with me
I see you glance at me
That's why I'm asking B
So let's party B
Come and dance with me

If I'm out on my own
Then I can look at you, looking at me
If I'm out on a date
Then I just shut my eyes, then I can't see
Get away from the bar
Tell your boyfriend to hold your jar
And dance with me

I see you glance at me
That's why I'm asking B
So let's party B
Come and dance with me

Yo! It goes on and on
I see you get excited like, this is my song
You think I want to get involved, you're not wrong
Cus I've been waiting for this moment all night long
So I creep creep creep like TLC
I've got my left eye checking out your scenery
I've got my right eye right where it needs to be
No matter how I look at it, you look good to me
Still, I'm looking for the perfect view
The way I see it that's right next to you
I know you've probably heard it before but I still
I love the way you flex like that for real
So don't stop doing what you do when you do it
I just wanna be a part of it when you do it
I feel like a wolly if I don't pursue it
And I can't go through it so let's go to it

She aint no oh
Look at those thighs, it's in her eyes she's good to go
She can satisfy my mind body and soul

Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come dance with me
I see you glance at me
That's why I'm asking B
So let's party B
Come and dance with me

I know you didn't come out to stand and stare
You bought new shoes and you did up your hair
You made a real effort tonight and it shows
I can tell by your face you don't wanna be alone
Cus the mood is right and the time is now
And if you can't do it I'll show you how
All you gotta do is get loose, let go
Just spark up your shades, put your skills on show

Oh
If I'm out on my own
Then I can look at you, looking at me
If I'm out on a date
Then I just shut my eyes, then I can't see
Get away from the bar
Tell your boyfriend to hold your jar
And dance with me

I see you glance at me
That's why I'm asking B
So let's party B
Come and dance with me

If I'm out on my own
Then I can look at you, looking at me

549,702.0,Dizzee Rascal,Holiday,"Get your passport and your bikini
You need a holiday, come see me
I know you're tired of the same old scenery
And I could change all that so easily
Don't worry about a thing girl, take a chance
I'll take you to the South of France, like Cannes
If anyone can I can
Or we can go shopping in Milan
I just hope you understand
I hope you see it clear
It really don't matter how far or near
Cus there's no distance that can stop my persistence
It's just a few days in the year
Plus I've got clout so let's ride out
We ain't gotta fly, we can just drive out
We can have a rave or we can hide out
I won't tell nobody let them find out

If you ain't doing nothing let's fly away
Drive away, get away
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
If you ain't doing nothing let's fly away
Drive away, take a holiday
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby

Don't watch my passport photo, I know I look a bit loco
And I know that my Spanish is so-so
But let's try keep that on the low-low
Cus we're going Ibiza
I've got friends that really wanna meet ya
With champagne and a whole lot of love
It's all good darling in the Blue Marlin Ibiza
And I'll never let your belly get empty
Even when your belly's full you're still sexy
We can ride speed boats, we can ride jet skis
I'll show you the time of your life if you let me
I just want to put a smile on your pretty face
If I didn't it'd just be a pretty waste
So you look like a girl with a bit of taste
So I couldn't take you just any place

If you ain't doing nothing let's fly away
Drive away, get away
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
If you ain't doing nothing let's fly away
Drive away, take a holiday
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby

I know you're really busy and I know you've got plans
But are you really too busy for a sun tan?
I ain't talking about walking down the high street
I'm talking about laying on a bright white beach
With a Pina Colada or whatever you'd rather
White wine, that's fine, just give me a lager
Then after we'll take a truck to the night spot, the hot spot, the top spot
Party around the clock
And when we get there it's strictly VIP
No need for ID, security know me
No waiting in line, no high entry fee
Don't worry about nothing when you're beside me
I'll get you lively and loosen you up
Have a bit of champagne it'll boost you up
I wanna move you up, I wanna take you away
So in other words darling, what do you say?

If you ain't doing nothing let's fly away
Drive away, get away
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
If you ain't doing nothing let's fly away
Drive away, take a holiday
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby"

Y'all gon' make me lose my mind

Y'all gon' make me go all out
up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a FOOL
up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
up in here, up in here

[DMX]
If I gotsta bring it to you cowards then it's gonna be quick, aight
All your mens up in the jail before, suck my dick
and all them other cats you run with, get done with, dumb quick
How the fuck you gonna cross the dog with some bum shit? Aight
There go the gun click, nine one one shit
All over some dumb shit, ain't that some shit
Y'all niggaz remind me of a strip club, cause everytime
you come around, it's like (what) I just gotta get my dick sucked
And I don't know who the fuck you think you talkin to
but I'm not him, aight slim? So watch what you do
Or you gon' find yourself, buried next to someone else
and we all thought you loved yourself
But that couldn't have been the issue, or maybe
they just sayin that, now cause they miss you
Shit a nigga tried to diss you
That's why you layin on your back, lookin at the roof of the church
Preacher tellin the truth and it hurts

Chorus

[DMX]
Off the chain I leave niggaz soft in the brain
cause niggaz still want the fame, off the name
First of all, you ain't rapped long enough
to be fuckin with me and you, you ain't strong enough
So whatever it is you puffin on that got you think that you Superman
I got the Kryptonite, should I smack him with my dick and the mic?
Y'all niggaz is characters, not even good actors
What's gon' be the outcome? Hmm, let's add up all the factors
You wack, you're twisted, your girl's a hoe
You're broke, the kid ain't yours, and e'rybody know
Your old man say you stupid, you be like, &quot;So?
I love my baby mother, I never let her go&quot;
I'm tired of weak ass niggaz whinin over puss
that don't belong to them, fuck is wrong with them?
They fuck it up for real niggaz like my mans and them
who get it on on the strength of the hands with them, MAN

Chorus

[DMX]
I bring down rains so heavy it curse the head
No more talkin - put him in the dirt instead
You keep walin - lest you tryin to end up red
Cause if I end up fed, y'all end up dead
Cause youse a soft type nigga
Fake up North type nigga
Puss like a soft white nigga
Dog is a dog, blood's thicker than water
We done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter
The bigger the order, the more guns we brought out
We run up in there, e'rybody come out, don't nobody run out
Sun in to sun out, I'ma keep the gun out
Nigga runnin his mouth? I'ma blow his lung out
Listen, yo' ass is about to be missin
You know who gon' find you? (Who?) Some old man fishin
Grandma wishin your soul's at rest
but it's hard to digest with the size of the hole in your chest

When I saw the break of day
I wished that I could fly away
Instead of kneeling in the sand
Catching teardrops in my hand

My heart is drenched in wine
You'll be on my mind
Forever

Out across the endless sea
I would die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road alone

My heart is drenched in wine
You'll be on my mind

I just left my baby girl a message, said I won't be coming home
I'd rather be alone
She doesn't fully understand me
Cause I'd rather leave than to cheat
If she gives me some time

I could be the man she needs
But there's a lot of lust inside me
And we've been together since our teenage years
I really don't mean to hurt her
But I need some time to be alone

(chorus)
But when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
Oh how, I feel so sad
Now that I wanna leave
She's crying her heart to me
How could you let this be
I just need time to see
Where I wanna be
Where I wanna be

(verse two)
Never did I imagine that you would play a major part
In decision that's so hard
Do I leave? Do I stay? Do I go?
Think about my life and what matters to me the most
Girl, the love that we share is real
But in time your heart will heal
I'm not saying I'm gone but I
Have to find what life is like without you

Y'all know me, still the same ole G, but I been low key
Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys, no boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all fulla tracks to add to the walls fulla plaques
Hanging up in the office and back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my doe freeze, hoe please, you betta bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees? Who you think brought you the Oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cubes and D.O.C's,
The Snoop D-O double G's and the group that said mother fuck the police
Gave you a tape full dope beats to bump when you stroll through in ya hood
And when you albums sales wasn't doin' too good who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely, all you niggas that said that I'd turned pop
On the firm flop, y'all are the reason Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all
If y'all don't like me... Blow me
Y'all gone keep fuckin' around with me and turn me back to the old me

{Eminem} {Chorus} (2x)
Nowadays everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips,
Jus a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act, like they Forgot About Dre

{Second Verse}
So what do you say to some body you hate? (What)
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve thing's in a bloodier way? (Yup)
Just study a tape of NWA
One day I was walkin by, with a walkman on, when I caught a guy
Givin me an awkward eye so I strangled him off at the parkin lot with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not I'm harder than me tryna park a dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck right next to a humongous truck in a two car garage
Hoppin out with 2 broken legs tryna walk it off, fuck you too bitch, call the cops
I'ma kill you and them loud ass motherfuckin barkin dogs
And when the cops came through me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches and still weren't found out (Right here)
So from here goin out it's the Chronic Two, startin today and tomorrows the new
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death wit a Charleston chew
chikka-chikka-chikka Slim Shady, hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up when the temp goes up to the mid 80's
Callin men ladies
Sorry doc but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's OK go with him Hailey (Da Da?)

{Chorus}(2x)

{Dr Dre} {Third Verse}
If it was up to me you motherfuckers would stop comin' up to me with ya hands out
Lookin' up to me, like you want somethin' free
When my last CD was out you wasn't bumpin' me
But now that I gots a lil company everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me cause I'm from the streets of Compton!
I told 'em all, all them lil gangsters who you think help mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talk about guns like I ain't got none
What you think I sold 'em all?
Cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin Dre fell off?
What Cause I been in the lab with a pen n a pad tryna get this damn label off?
I ain't havin that
This is the millennium of Aftermath and ain't gonna be nothin after that
So gimmie one more platinum plaque and fuck rap, you can have it back
So wheres all the mad rappers at? It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats when you were cuddlin' a cabbage patch

Better love next time baby, someone will be waiting down the line
With better love, better love, better love, better love next time

Sometimes it's better to let it all go
I've been there and I think I should know
So have a good cry, wash out your heart
If you keep it inside it'll tear you apart
Sometimes you lose but you're gonna win if you just, if you just, keep hanging in

You'll find
Better love next time baby, don't give up and I know you're gonna find
Better love next time baby, someone will be waiting down the line

And I say the same thing every single time.

Call me when its no one there
Put the key under the mat
And you know I'll be over there
(Yup) I'll be over there
Shawty, I'll be over there
I'll be hitting all the spots that u ain't even know was there
Ha. And you ain't even have to ask twice
You can have my heart or we can share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustom to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chilling with no make up on
That's when your the prettiest
I hope that you don take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along
You know that I'm working I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to them rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one to Never get confused with Cause.

Baby you my everything you all i ever wanted.
We can do it real big.
Bigger then you ever done it.
You be up on everything.
Other hoes ain't never on it.
I want this forever, i swear i can spend whatever on it.

Baby I be on that tank shit
Buzz so big i could probably sell a blank disk
When my album drop
Bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl
But money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee
Cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make yo pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on
double cup love
You the one i lean on
Feeling for a fix then you should really get yo pheen on
Yea just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there repping like a mascot
Get it from the back
And make yo fucking bra strap pop
All up in yo slot until the nigga hit the jackpots

Baby you my everything you all i ever wanted.
We can do it real big.
Bigger then you ever done it.
You be up on everything.
Other hoes ain't never on it.
I want this forever, i swear i can spend whatever on it.

Hey, Hey, Hey
And I feel it taking over

[Chorus]
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love
Then nothings gonna tear us apart
I’m more than just a number
Hey, Hey, Hey
I doubt you’ll find another
Hey, Hey, Hey
So every single summer
Hey, Hey, Hey
I be the one that you remember

[Chorus]
And I better find your lovin
I better find your heart
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love,
Then nothings gonna tear us apart
It’s more than just a mission
Hey, Hey, Hey
You hear but you don’t listen
Hey, Hey, Hey
You better pay attention
Hey, Hey, Hey
And get what you been missing

[Chorus]
Too many times I’ve been wrong
I guess being right takes too long
I’m done waiting, theres nothing left to do
But give all I have to you and
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and
I bet if I give all my love,
Then nothings gonna tear us apart
I bet if I give all my love,
Then nothings gonna tear us apart"
580,547.0,Drake,"Forever (feat. Kanye West, Lil Wayne & Eminem)","[Chorus - Drake]
It may not mean nothing to y’all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don’t plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I’m shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain’t even planning to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man

[Verse 1 - Drake]
Last name Ever
First name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle boy ain’t nothing to play with
It started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis
And your city faded off to brown, Nino
She insists she got more class, we know!
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I ball, Kimo
Drop the mixtape that shit sounded like an album
Who’d have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside an X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah nigga I’m about my business
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain’t been a part of it at least you got to witness
Bitches

[Chorus - Drake]
It may not mean nothing to y’all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don’t plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I’m shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain’t even planning to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man

[Verse 2 - Kanye West]
I used to have hood dreams
Big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y’all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young
You can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they can build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button, whaat, nottin’
Now Superbad chicks getting me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle’s husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn’t
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasn’t
You’re such a fucking loser
He didn’t even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can’t even act
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever y’all can have it back

[Chorus - Drake]
It may not mean nothing to y’all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don’t plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I’m shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain’t even planning to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man

[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]
Ok, hello its the martian
Space Jam Jordan’s
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest
Step up to the target
If I had one guess than I guess I’m just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I’m running from the cops
Hop upped in my car and told my chauffeur “to the top”
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for? this is my theme park
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side you don’t wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that’s what they got to say or mention
I’m like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I’m resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foots sleeping on the gas
No brake pads no such thing as last
Huh!

[Chorus - Drake]
It may not mean nothing to y’all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don’t plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I’m shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain’t even planning to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man

[Verse 4 - Eminem]
There they go, packing stadiums
As Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamia they go so balistic whoa
We can make them look like boso’s
He’s wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no go for broke
His cup just runneth over oh no
He ain’t had a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They’ve been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can’t put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I’m talking about when we riot
You dealin’ with a few true villains
Who stand inside of the booth truth spillin’
And spit true feelings, til our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths
Now rewind it
Payback mutherfucka for the way you doubted me so how’s it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I’m Hannibal Lecter so just in case your thinking of saving face
You ain’t gonna have no face to save by the time I’m through with this place
So Drake….

[Chorus - Drake]
It may not mean nothing to y’all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don’t plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
I’m shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain’t even planning to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man"

Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go...
Go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

[Verse 1: E-40]
Ooh. Jesus Christ had dreads, so shake em
I aint got none, but I'm planning on growing some
Imagine all the Hebrews going dumb
Dancing on top of chariots and turning tight ones (eeerrrrr!)
Ooh, tell me when to go (dumb)
Talking on my Ghettro on the way to the store
... My 2nd or 3rd trip
Some Henny, some Swishers and some Listerine strips
Dr. Greenthumb lips, just to ease my thoughts
Not just the cops, but the homies you got to watch
The moon is full, look at the dark clouds
Sitting in my scraper, watching Oakland Gone Wild... Ta-dow
I don't bump mainstream, I knock underground
All that other shit, sugar-coated and watered down
I'm from the Bay where we hyphy and go dumb
From the soil where them rappers be getting their lingo from

Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go...
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go...
Go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

[Verse 2: Keak Da Sneak]
I'm off that 18 dummy juice
.... Yadamean, labeled the Black Zeus
King of the super dooper hyphy (hyphy, hyphy, hyphy, hyphy)
And your wife, she don't like me (like me, like me, like me, like me)
&gt;From the Bay to the A
Put me in the back wood, Swisher sweet bud, orange lace (Let's go, it's dope)
Bitches wish I wrote, I said they couldn't be saved by John the Pope (John the Pope)
I slid past on the gas, bitches looking at me
It's good, it's good like the granddaddy
Cross game, you get flipped like a burger patty
Or zig-zagged... pass me a big old fatty
.... I drink white, with a snow bunny
Talking big shit in the scraper, going hella dummy

Yadada mean, yadada I'm saying though

Don't say I'm a liar that I don't love you
Something has brought me down but I won't give up hope
It's hard for you to cope when I'm around you

Let the sun break through
The cracks within my room
The grey sky fades to blue
It might wash away this gloom

Alcohol, company I need to readjust
From this place of dust let's go drink tonight
And at the bar we'll drink 'til dawn and I'll pretend I'm dead
Whilst resting my poor head by the neon light

Let the sun break through
The cracks within my room
The grey sky fades to blue
It might wash away this gloom

The birds will sing for us but we all die in the end
The birds will sing for us but we all die in the end
The birds will sing for us, the birds will sing for us

621,1745.0,Special Ed,Think About It,"Sometime I wanna rhyme, but then again I must wait
For the approaching of a toy to introduce him to his fate
Death, I always try to figure out why
Sucker MC's wanna battle me when they know they will die
In the end, so why pretend you're livin trifle
I'ma rope you up like a cowboy, stifle
Your throat with my microphone cord, cause I'm the lord
Of the rhyme, some people say that they can never get bored
Cause I'm exciting, pleasurable listening
I'm only tryin to show you what your records keep on missing, and
I'm only tryin to help our your crew, and
I know I must forgive ya, cause you don't know what you're doin
So sucker MC's, please think twice
Would you join the navy if you didn't like the gravy and rice?
Think about it

(Think about it)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Think about that, then think about this
If I tried to hit you, do you think that I would miss?
Well, I'm fast, I only hit the center, mass and head
I'm Special Ed, funkadelic relic of the ages
If you like this, then I got pages and pages
Some dumb bubbleyum bubblegum chewin
Chumps be screwin
I the fly, I wonder why
What's the reason for the treason, huh, you wanna die?
I'm high-post, higher than most
Not from France, but I eat french toast
I'm international, I make the cash in all ways
Got dollars in my pocket, cause man, it pays
To be smart, I turn my art into an empire
Cause I grow and grow, so you know I never tire
Got the status and the clout, no doubt
Of all time, I got the rhyme to take you out
Cause my rap is like a trap that you fall into
I'm Special Ed, now who the hell are you?
You're unknown, don't even own a microphone
You can't rap, you make me wanna cap a stone
In your eye, why do you persist to make noise
When ever since I was a kid I never did like toys
I get furious, leavin MC's curious
In a daze, my hits do faze
I recommend you listen to the phrase that pays
Don't jest, you won't succeed
I make you bleed till you need a transfusion
This is no illusion
I know you're gettin blurried, don't worry, it's confusion
Of the mind, don't whine, you can't cry forever
It'll take your life to decipher the clever
Rhymes that I say in the way that I do
Akshun Luv, my deejay, I guess it's on you
But is there anybody better? I doubt it
And if you think you are, I think you better think about it

(Think about it)

[ VERSE 3 ]
The lyrics are suffice, suffice are my lyrics
Idolized by the public, praised by the critics
Worth more than gold, longer than a giraffe
Take em to the pawn shop, get a yard and a half
And I'm the creator of the rhymes you praise
All of y'all with the gall I will leave in a daze
Try to battle me, and I'ma make it my job
To burn you as I turn you like a shishkebab
Cause yo, the style that I portrait is the style of a leader
If you' re really gonna battle me, you're really gonna need a
Whole crew, not two, three or four
You gonna need a whole posse, a mossie or more
Cause I'm strong, rap long, yet the rhymes don't drag
Like a bag full of tricks or a trick in a bag
I'm uprising, surprising
Not a nag, not antagonizing
Cause I'm full of fun, and I got a gun
To kill MC's fresher than me, but there are none
Cause I've looked everywhere
Under every rock, in every chair
MC's they try to hide when I get hot
I know that they hide, but where I know not
You're nothin but a sucker, chump you're scared
You tried to battle me, but you wasn't prepared
You slept, I crept up, shot your drawers
And now you're runnin for your life like you're swimmin from Jaws
But go, I know that you've learned your lesson
Go to church, just confess, and
Tell the preacher you committed sin
You battled Special Ed when you couldn't win
Tried, you cried, you shouted, you pouted
But I told ya - you should thought about it

Now I'm missing you and I'm wishing you would come back through my door
Why did you have to go?
You could have let me know
So now I'm all alone

Girl you could have stayed but you wouldn't give me a chance
With you not around it's a little bit more than I can stand
And all my tears they keep runnin' down my face
Why did you turn away?

So why does your pride make you run and hide
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lie what you keep inside
This is not how you want it to be

So baby I will wait for you
Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life

Baby I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do
I'll wait for you

Been a long time since you called me
(How could you forget about me)
You gotta be feeling crazy
How can you walk away
(When) Everything stays the same
I just can't do it baby

What will it take to make you come back
Girl I told you what it is and it just ain't like that
Why can't you look at me?
You're still in love with me
Don't leave me crying

Baby why can't we just start all over again
Get it back to the way it was
If you give me a chance I can love you right
But you're telling me it won't be enough

So baby I will wait for you
Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life

Baby I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do
I'll wait for you

So why does your pride make you run and hide
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lie what you're keeping inside
That is not how you want it to be

Baby I will wait for you
Baby I will wait for you
If it's the last thing I do

Baby I will wait for you
Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life

Baby I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do
I'll wait for you
I'll be waiting..."
635,32.0,Elvis Presley,Little Sister,"Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you kiss me once or twice
Then say it's very nice
And then you run

Little sister dont you do what your big sister does
Well, I dated your big sister
And took her to a show
I went for some candy
Along came Jim Dandy
And they snuck right out of the door

Ev'ry time I see your sister
Well she's got somebody new
She's mean and she's evil
Like that old Boll Weevil
Guess I'll try my luck with you

Well, I used to pull your pigtails
And pinch your turned-up nose
But you been a growin'
And baby, it's been showin'
From your head down to your toes

Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you kiss me once or twice
Then say it's very nice
And then you run

Little sister, don't you
Do what your big sister done"
636,1365.0,Emeli Sandé,"Read All About It, Pt. III",
637,3.0,Eminem,'Till I Collapse (feat. Nate Dogg),"[Intro:]
Cause sometimes you just feel tired.
You feel weak and when you feel weak you feel like you wanna just give up.
But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
and just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
and not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse.

[B/W Intro:]
Go left, go left, go left right left
Go left, go left, go left right left
Go left, go left, go left right left
Go left, go left, go left right left

[Verse #1:]
Till I collapse I’m spilling these raps long as you feel em
Till the day that I drop you’ll never say that I’m not killing them
Cause when I am not then I am stop pinning them
And I am not hip-hop and I’m just not Eminem.
Subliminal thoughts when I’m stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hauk venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop. Amoxacilin is just not real
enough.
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners.
Your coming with me, feel it or not you’re gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god
lives in us.
You hear it a lot, lyrics the shock is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up.
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up you pizzles forgot slizzle does not give a
fuck.

[Chorus - NateDogg]
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out and my high wear out
I’ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out and my high wear out
I’ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.

[Verse #2:]
Music is like magic there’s a certain feeling you get when your real
and you spit and people are feeling your shit.
This is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it
cause you may never get it again.
So while you’re in it try to get as much shit as you can
and when your run is over just admit when its at its end.
Cause I’m at the end of my wits with half this shit that gets in.
I got a list here’s the order of my list that it’s in.
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from Outcast, Jada, Kurupt,
Nas and then me. But in this industry I’m the cause of a lot of envy,
so when I’m not put on this list the shit does not offend me.
That’s why you see me walk around like nothing’s bothering me.
Even though half you people got a fucken problem with me.
You hate it but you know respect you’ve got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate hit me.

[Chorus - NateDogg]

[Verse #3:]
Soon as a verse starts I eat it at MC’s heart
what is he thinking? I'ma not to go against me, smart.
And its absurd how people hang on every word.
I’ll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I’ll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first.
Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse.
That’s why I’m clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I’m an addict
I rap like I’m addicted to smack like I’m Kim Mathers.
But I don’t want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bump some rappers.
So this is like a full blown attack I’m launching at them
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
Cause I don’t really think that the fact that I’m Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I’m not the baddest.

[Chorus - NateDogg]

[Outro:]
[Eminem & Natedogg Echo:]
Until the roof
The roof comes off
Until my legs
give out form underneath me

[Eminem:]
I will not fall,
I will stand tall,
Feels like no one could beat me"

The way you shake it, I can't believe it

Please, I'm a human being, I have needs

And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee, pee, pee
Yes, I make r&b, I sing song it go
Ring-a-chong, a-ching-chong-chong-chong-ching

Geez, I just got my seat
I have ticket, look, I put away, my zipper's zipped

And don't treat me like I'm pee wee herman, this movies PG
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea and be free
Free, yes, free, right back on the streets

The way you shake it, I can't believe it

I need a new boyfriend, hi my name is JoJo
Police saying ""freeze""
Doing, doing, doing

My computers would be seized and my keys to my ranch
I just baked cookies Mr. Officer, looky, take a whiff of these
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me, no not even me

On the radio, but I think I did

640,313.0,Eminem,Cleanin' Out My Closet,"Intro:
Where's my snare
I have no snare on my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo yo

Have you ever been hated, or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid thats behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin', and takin' names in the evenin'
Leaving with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigga me, but they'll neva figure me out
Look at me now, I betcha probley sick of me now
Ain't you mama, I 'ma make you look so ridiculous now

Chorus:
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet
One more time
I said
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
Ha!

I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD
I was a baby maybe I was just a coupla months
My faggot father must?ve had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed my goodbye
No I don't, on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leaving her side,
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try to make it work
Wit her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
Cause I'd of killed 'em shit I woulda shot Kim and them both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome ya'll to the Eminem show

[Chorus]

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through hear purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
' Til I grew up, now I blew up it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, MA?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, MA?
But guess what, ya gettin' olda now and it?s cold when yaw lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that yaw phony
And Hailie's getting' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your FUNERAL
See whets hurts me the most, is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep tellin' yaself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take when you didn't help me to get,
you selfish bitch
I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!!

and we're starting this party from dusk,

Ok, let's go!

Back when Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk.
Fix your must, youll just be another one bit the dust .
Just one up my mothers son who got thrown under the bus.
Kiss my butt, Lick Fromunda cheese from under my nuts.
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks,
Its a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed,
Bitches lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut,
Fist the cut. The lady give her eighty some paper cut,
Now picture us, Its ridiculous you curse at the thought,
Cuz when I spit the verse the shit gets worse and worse cuz your soft,
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time,
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes,
Its elementary, The elephants have entered the room,
I venture to say with the center of attention its true,
Not to mention back with a vengeance so heres the signal,
Of the bat symbol, The platinum trio's back on you hoes,

So crack a bottle,

They see that low rider go by, they're like Oh my!
You aint got to tell me why youre sick cuz I know why,
I dip through in that six trey, like sick em Dre,
Im an itch that they cant scratch, theyre sick of me,
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA.
Cuz over and above all, its just another day,
And this one begins where the last one ends,
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again,
Ill be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz,
Driving around with a smashed front end,
Lets cash that one in,
Grab another one from out the stable,
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Derado?
The hell if I know,
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, Garage looks like precision collision,
Or maico beats quake like Waco,
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though.

642,904.0,Eminem,Lose Yourself,"Look, if you had, one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, BLOW!
Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke, he's so stacked that he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't collapse on him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

The soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post-mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, god only knows he's grown farther from home
He's no father, he goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cuz here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partner
But the beat goes on da da dum da dum da da

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

No more games, I'm a change what you call rage
Tear this mothafuckin' roof off like 2 dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin', stepped writin' the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my nine to five
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cuz, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mikhai Pfeiffer
This is my life, and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus
Teetertotter caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only mothafuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go with my shot, feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

643,973.0,Eminem,Like Toy Soldiers,"[Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down...

[Chorus]
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

[Verse 1]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to
I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever just pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
Now the Ja shit i tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this shit be way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I help build
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' Shug
Now it's just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over t.v. down talkin' a man who literally saved my life
Like fuck it i understand this is business
And this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute cuz

[Chorus]
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

[Verse 2]
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated cuz once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it
Meanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his ressurection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up cuz one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
Well fuck it, that mutherfucker can get it too, fuck him then
But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
To have Runion Avenue Soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered
There ain't words that I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Then to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the virdict
I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man
If ya'll can quit poppin' off at your jaws with the knockin'
Cuz frankly I'm sick of talkin'

644,974.0,Eminem,Like Toy Soldiers,"[Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down...

[Chorus]
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

[Verse 1]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to
I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever just pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
Now the Ja shit i tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this shit be way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I help build
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' Shug
Now it's just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over t.v. down talkin' a man who literally saved my life
Like fuck it i understand this is business
And this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute cuz

[Chorus]
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

[Verse 2]
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated cuz once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it
Meanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his ressurection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up cuz one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
Well fuck it, that mutherfucker can get it too, fuck him then
But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
To have Runion Avenue Soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered
There ain't words that I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Then to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the virdict
I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man
If ya'll can quit poppin' off at your jaws with the knockin'
Cuz frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience cuz

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers

645,1007.0,Eminem,Lose Yourself,"Look, if you had, one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, BLOW!
Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke, he's so stacked that he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't collapse on him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

The soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post-mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, god only knows he's grown farther from home
He's no father, he goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cuz here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partner
But the beat goes on da da dum da dum da da

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

No more games, I'm a change what you call rage
Tear this mothafuckin' roof off like 2 dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin', stepped writin' the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my nine to five
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cuz, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mikhai Pfeiffer
This is my life, and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus
Teetertotter caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only mothafuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go with my shot, feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

There's a certain mystique when I speak,
that you notice that's sorta unique,

you can't sit still, it's like tryin to smoke crack
and go to sleep, I'm strapped,
just knowing any minute I could snap,
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped,
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically,
it ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry,
it ain't even money, you can't pay me enough
for you to play me, it's cockamamie,
you just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady,
my noodle is cockadoodle, my clocks cuckoo,
I got screws loose, yeah, the whole kit 'n' kaboodle,
I'm just brutal
It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it,

647,1109.0,Eminem,Mockingbird,"Yeah
I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me

Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
Well I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
Cuz you're scared, I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney uncles crazy, ain't he?
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

[Chorus]
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upperlip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise momma's gon' be alright

It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
Cuz daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
Cuz daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broke into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
And flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the T. V. and momma didn't like it
And you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin in this empty house, just reminiscing
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah
It's got a ring to it don't it?
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment

[Chorus]

And if you ask me too
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdies neck
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every karat don't fuck with dad (haha)"
648,1208.0,Eminem,Not Afraid,"""Not Afraid""

[Chorus:]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)

[Intro (during Chorus):]
Yeah, it's been a ride
I guess I had to, go to that place, to get to this one
Now some of you, might still be in that place
If you're trying to get out, just follow me
I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say I'ma do something I do it,
I don't give a damn what you think,
I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if it thinks it's stopping me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From ""Infinite"" down to the last ""Relapse"" album
He's still shitting, whether he's on salary paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt, and fuck the whole universe

[Chorus]

Okay quit playing with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth, for that
Fuck your fillings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last ""Relapse"" CD was ehhh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't going back to that now
All I'm trying to say is get back, click-clack, blow
Cause I ain't playing around
It's a game called circle and I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fucking black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!

[Chorus]

And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'ma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now! (now)

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
For you, so I could come back a brand new me you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead, no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it!
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub, and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazing at stars
I feel amazing and I'm...

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I..
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window..

It reminds me, that it's not so bad,

[Eminem as 'Stan']
Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
but anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

[Chorus: Dido]

[Eminem as 'Stan']
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad - I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you,
four hours and you just said, ""No.""
That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fuckin idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein lied to
Remember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you
you would write back - see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither;
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
so when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan -- P.S.
We should be together too

[Chorus: Dido]

[Eminem as 'Stan']
Dear Mister-I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans,
this'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word - I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters;
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
but didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy
and all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped +ALL+ of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it
I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE without me
See Slim; [*screaming*] Shut up bitch! I'm tryin to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin in the trunk
but I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how'm I supposed to send this shit out?
[*car tires squeal*] [*CRASH*]
.. [*brief silence*] .. [*LOUD splash*]

[Chorus: Dido]

[Eminem]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
and here's an autograph for your brother,
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin dogg,
c'mon - how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin just fine
if you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was.. it was you

Shady, Aftermath
There she goes shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin and grindin that pole
The way she's grindin that pole
I think I'm losing control

[Verse 1 - Eminem]

Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunked, get fucked up
Hit the strip club don't forget ones get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
Pasted, blasted, puke drink up, get a new drink
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine
Knowin still got a few chunks on your shoestring
Showin I was dehydrated till the beat vibrated
I was revibed as soon as this Bitch gyrated
And hips and licked them lips and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit

[Verse 2 - Nate Dogg]

Two to the one from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good trees
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
And I get more ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey
I've been to the muthafuckin mountain top
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo ass I'm gonna continue to rock
Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close cause strobe lights lie

[Verse 3 - Nate Dogg]

We bout to have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go head shake your butt)
I'm lookin for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are bout it bout it
I'm lookin for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say everyday she be givin it up

[Chorus - Nate Dogg]

Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Ohh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

[Verse 4 - Eminem]

I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rinse
Swish but don't spit it, swallow and I'll finish
Yeah me and Nate d-o double g
Looking for a couple bitches with some double d's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbuly, we finna finna have a party

[Verse 5 - Nate Dogg]

Have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go head shake your butt)
I'm lookin for a girl I can fuck in my hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big Ol' slut
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are bout it bout it
I want a bitch that sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can but she won't say no
Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut, will you be mine?
I heard you was freaky from a friend of mine

[Bridge - Eminem]

Now I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind

[Chorus - Nate Dogg]

Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Cmon girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Ohh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Cmon girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
We bout' to have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (go ahead shake your butt)
I'm lookin for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are bout it bout it
I'm lookin for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say everyday she be givin it up

[Outro - Eminem]

There she goes, shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin and grindin that pole
The way she's grindin that pole
I think I'm losing control

God, come one

[Eminem makes noises]

I ain't leavin' without you bitch

Coming home with me

And my boy, and his boy, and his boy, and his gurl

haha, Nate Dogg

651,1517.0,Eminem,Sing for the Moment,"These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing,
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child and what bothers him all comes out,
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out
Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap
His step-father hit him, so he socked him back,
And broke his nose his house is a broken home,
There's no control, he just let's his emotions go...

Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing with me now, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 2]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsta's
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate,
I guess words are a mothafucka they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have,
they want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me,
strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously,
so i'm signin' cd's while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If i'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense Pete
It's all political, if my music is literal,
and i'm a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to,
you're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you...

Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing with me now, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 3]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you, and cock it too?
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and i'll get sued
See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves, we entertainers
Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus
But music is reflection of self, we just explain it,
And then we get our checks in the mail - It's fucked up ain't it?
How we can come from practically nothing
to being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids, who don't have a thing
Except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in their lives
Till they sit and they cry at night wishin' they'd die
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit, and they vibe
We're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it,
Squeeze it and hold it cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone just let our spirits live on,
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can...

[CHORUS X2]
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing with me now, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away"

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I..
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window..
and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray,
but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
it's not so bad..

[1st Chorus: volume gradually grows over raindrop background]
[2nd Chorus: full volume with beat right after ""thunder"" noise]

[Eminem as 'Stan']
Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
but anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

[Chorus: Dido]

[Eminem as 'Stan']
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad - I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you,
four hours and you just said, ""No.""
That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fuckin idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein lied to
Remember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you
you would write back - see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither;
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
so when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan -- P.S.
We should be together too

[Chorus: Dido]

[Eminem as 'Stan']
Dear Mister-I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans,
this'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word - I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters;
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
but didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy
and all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped +ALL+ of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it
I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE without me
See Slim; [*screaming*] Shut up bitch! I'm tryin to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin in the trunk
but I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how'm I supposed to send this shit out?
[*car tires squeal*] [*CRASH*]
.. [*brief silence*] .. [*LOUD splash*]

[Chorus: Dido]

[Eminem]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
and here's an autograph for your brother,
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin dogg,
c'mon - how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin just fine
if you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was.. it was you
Damn!"

654,1724.0,Eminem,The Real Slim Shady,"May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here...

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, suin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a GRAMMY?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, ‘cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, ‘cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Hello boys and girls
Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships
Do you have a daddy?
I'll bet you do

*Door opens*
who's your daddy?

Hailie:
Daddy, what're you doing?

Beat starts

Eminem:

Eminem & Hailie:
Ok then! everybody, listen up!

Eminem:
I'm goin' to hell, who's comin' with me?

Hailie:
Somebody, please help him!
*giggle*
i think my dad gone crazy!

Verse #1:
There's no mountain i can't climb, there's no tower too high,
No plane that i can't learn how to fly
What do i gotta do to get through to you, to show you
There ain't nothing i can't take this chainsaw to
*Hailey Makes Chainsaw Sound* Fuckin' brains brawn, and brass balls
I cut 'em off, then got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall, with my framed autograph,
Sunglasses with Elton John's name, on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, i been lying my ass off
All this time, me and Dre been fucking with hats off

Dr Dre:
Suck it Marshall

Eminem:
Tell laura and her husband to back off
Before i push this motherfucking button and blast off
And launch one of these russians, and that's all
*Hailie Makes Explosion Sound* Blow every fucking thing, except Afghanistan on the map, off
We wanna stop, we wanna knock the crap off
*Knocking* Haley, tell 'em baby

Haley:
My dad's lost it

Chorus:
Eminem:
There's really nothin' else to say ha, i can't explain it
Hailie:
I think my dad gone crazy!
Eminem:
A little help from Hailie jade won't ya tell em', maybe
Hailie:
I think my dad gone crazy!
Eminem:
Theres nothing you could do or say that could ever change me
Hailie:
I think my dad gone crazy!
Eminem:
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
Hailie:
I think my dad gone crazy!

Verse 2:
It's like my mother always told me
*Eminem Impersinates His Mom* Rnrnrnrnrnrrrr, n codeine
n goddamit, you little motherfucker
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'
Er.. Fuck that shit, bitch,
eat a motherfuckin' dick Chew on a prick, and lick
a million motherfuckin' cocks per second
I'd rather put out a motherfucking gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch, eat pussy
And have pussy-lips glued to my face with a clit-ring
in my nose then quit bringin' my flos,
Quit giving me my ammo Can't you see why i'm so
mean? if y'all leave me alone, this wouldn't be my M.O.
I wouldn't have to go eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a homo by his toe, man i don't know no more
Am i the only fuckin' one who's normal any more?

Hailey:
Dad!

Chorus

Verse #3:
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
And at the same time, make you dry your eyes
with the same rhyme - so what you're seeing is a genius at work
Which to me isn't work, so it's easy to misinter-
pret it at first, cuz when i speak, it's tongue in cheek
I'd yank my fuckin' teeth
before i'd ever bite my tongue I'd slice my gums,
get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as vanilla ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit, every time i sung
Like R. Kelly as soon as bump n' grind comes on
More pain inside o' my brain,
than in the eyes of a little girl inside of a plane
aimed at the world trade, standin' on Ronny's grave,
Screaming at the sky, the clouds gather its Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And that's pretty much the gist of it
Parents are pissed, but the kids love it
Nine millimeter, heaters stashed in two-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, i wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither

Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the Dr. when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating ""Hey""
You waited this long to stop debating
Cuz I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney
But your husbands heart problem is complicated
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready cuz this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, ""Fuck you Debbie!""

Now this looks a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prison is helpless,
Til someone comes along on a mission and yells ""bitch""
A visionary, vision is scary, could start a revolution,
Pollutin' the air waves a rebel
So let me just revel and bask,
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me?
Well I'm back fix your bent antenna
Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter
Into the front of your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
Testing ""Attention Please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me

A tisk-it a task-it,
I go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards,
And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie,
You 36 year old bald headed fag blow me
You don't know me, you're too old
Let go, it's over, nobody listens to techno
Now lets go, just give me the signal
I will be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems,
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm dis-gus-ting,
But its just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley,
To do Black Music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)
There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me

Will I see again

We are always running for the thrill of it thrill of it
Always pushing up the hill searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on we are calling out and out again
Never looking down I'm just in awe of what's in front of me

Is it real now
When two people become one
I can feel it
When two people become one

Thought I'd never see
The love you found in me
Now it's changing all the time
Living in a rhythm where the minutes working overtime

Catch me I'm falling down
Catch me I'm falling down

If birds flying south is a sign of changes
At least you can predict this every year.
Love, you never know the minute it ends suddenly
I can’t get it to speak
Maybe finding all the things it took to save us
I could fix the pain that bleeds inside of me
Look in your eyes to see something about me
I’m standing on the edge and I don’t know what else to give.

Do you know what it feels like loving someone that’s in a rush to throw you away.
Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed.

How can I love you How can I love you How can I love you How can I love you. . . .
If you just don’t talk to me, babe.

I flow through my act
The question is she needed

And decide all the man I can ever be.
Looking at the last 3 years like I did,
I could never see us ending like this.

Seeing your face no more on my pillow
Is a scene that’s never ever happened to me.

Up and down but maybe this time

It's hard to just forget the past
So fast
It was good
It was bad but it was real and that's
All you have
In the end our love mattered

They disappear, before our very eyes

Live it up tonight, move on
It's time we gave it up tonight
Live it up tonight

We won, we lost, we tried
Be a saint, i'm fine cos i died
I'm so sick and tired of crying
So tonight, it's time, just fly
So now we got so close
Caught up in the deal

The only thing we had is real

Though it hurts so bad
To say goodbye
I know my love for you
Is still alive

Only thing that make it better though

And I know you feeling that
Regardless of your frontin
And I heard through the streets

And approach, is you real or not?

Uh, uh, uh, huh
Yo, yo
Drop your glasses, shake your asses
Face screwed up like you having hot flashes
Which one, pick one, this one, classic
Red from blonde, yeah bitch I'm drastic
Why this, why that, lips stop askin
Listen to me baby, relax and start passin
Expressway, head back, weavin' through the traffic
This one strong should be labeled as a hazard
Some of y'all niggas hot, sike I'm gassin'
Clowns I spot em and I can't stop laughin'
Easy come, easy go, E-V gon' be lastin'
Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic
Some of y'all aint writin well, too concerned with fashion
None of you aint Gisell, cat walk and imagine
Alotta y'all Hollywood, drama, passed it
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it

CHORUS:
[Gwen Stefani]
And if I had to give you more,
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door
And I aint goin' nowhere
It took a while to get me here
And I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear
Now let me blow ya mind

[Eve]
They wanna bank up, crank up, makes me dizzy
Shank up, haters wanna come after me
You aint a ganster, prankster, too much to eat
Snakes in my path wanna smile up at me

Now why you grittin your teeth?
Frustration baby you gotta breathe
Take a lot more that you to get rid of me
You see I do what they can't do, I just do me
Aint no stress when it comes to sayin' ""Get what you see""
Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe?
Huh, sixteens mine, create my own lines
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find
Sophomore, I aint scared, one of a kind
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine
Eyes bloodshot, stressin', chills up your spine
Huh, sick to your stomach wishin I wrote your rhymes

CHORUS

[Eve]
Let your bones crack
Your back pop, I can't stop
Excitement, block shots from your stash box
Fuck it, thugged out, I respect the cash route
Locked down, blastin, sets while I mash out
Yeah nigga, mash out, D-R-E
Back track, think back, E-V-E
Do you like that (ooooh), you got to I know you
Had you in a trance first glance from the floor too
Don't believe I'll show you, take you with me
Turn you on, pension gone, give you relief
Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me
Damn she much thinner know now I'm complete(Uh-huh)
Still stallion, brick house, pile it on
Ryde or Die bitch, double R, came strong
Beware, cuz I crush anything I land on
Me here, aint no mistake nigga it was planned on

Dont try to fuck wit me yall
Cause you cant
Uhh, I stay way ahead of the game
Ya know, Catch me if you can nigga
Uhh, Haha

[Verse 1]
Throwback this, Throwback that
It aint where you for its where you wear ya throwback at
I rock the Reds Pete Rose when I'm in the 'Natti
And 4X, You cant see the semi-automatti
When I'm in the Chi' you think they aint that shocked
To see the kid roll through in the St. Pats Socks
So pull out the Chicago and the script to wear on Soul Train
The Bulls, When Mike had hair and a gold chain
I get the Spirit in St. Louis, How could the god lose
I do back flips in the Ozzie Cardinals
They love me in Cleveland, Everytime I travel there
I'm in the Indians or that Cavaliers
When I hit Minnesota, That kid from Brooklyn wear
The Vikings or the Timberwolves from Garnett's rookie year
And in Milwaukee I had to pimp it and go back
20 years with the Bucks and Brewers throw backs

[Chorus]
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It aint where you for its where you wear ya throwback at
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It aint where you for its where you wear ya throwback at

[Verse 2]
I might charge through San Diego with the bolts on my shoulder
Rock the Trailblazer warm-up, Cause Portland gets colder
And even the pimps be jealous
When I'm in the floor seat at the Forum in the M.P.L.S.
And they be askin' what teams on the kid chest
This the Rams before they moved to the Midwest
When I'm in the Bay with it, I dont play with it
Im in the Athletics with the matchin' A's fitted
This aint even for the minors
Cause they dont know nothin' bout the Joe Montana, 49ers
Seattle, Probally heard different rumors
Either about the Payton or the Griffey Jr.
I come through Denver like 4th quarter with Elway
Or the Nuggets that make them yell Ehhhh
In Pheonix I do the old Suns
Cause the new jerseys is cool, But nothings really like the old ones
Ya know

[Chorus]
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It aint where you for its where you wear ya throwback at
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It aint where you for its where you wear ya throwback at

[Verse 3]
In New York what I wear the the club may vary
Mets or Yankees like the Subway Series
When I'm in Boston I melt the bean
In a hot Red Soxs or Celtics green
In the city of Philly, I roll up on the biddes like feel these
In a size 56 Phillies
In Jersey I got the Nets on
That you can bet on
In D.C. I couldnt pull it
Without the Bullets
When I stop in Atlanta I cant talk long
Them birds know I got the Falcons or the Hawks on
That peach Tampa Bay dont hit the streets too often
Not even Miami could take the Heat of Dolphins
Aint no complaints on
When I'm in New Orleans with the Saints on
In Houston I pass hoes
In the Astros
In Dallas I always gotta have
The Cowboys or the Mavs
Tell Pete To keep it comin, And Imma keep it comin

[Chorus]
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It aint where you for its where you wear ya throwback at
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It aint where you for its where you wear ya throwback at"

That I don't think we can just dismiss

Sometimes the solution
Is worse than the problem
Let's stay together

Well I bought a ticket
To the revolution
And I cheered when the statues fell
Everyone came
To destroy what was rotten
But they killed off what was good as well

Sometimes the solution
Is worse than the problem
Let's stay together

Stay with me
This century
Together we're better

Oh, I learned a lesson

In a world, few hearts survive
All I know is the way I feel
When it's real, I keep it alive

The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb a step every day

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below, up where the clear winds blow

Some hang on to &quot;used to be&quot;
Live their lives, looking behind
All we have is here and now
All our life, out there to find

The road is long, there are mountains in our way
But we climb them a step every day

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world we know, up where the clear winds blow

Time goes by
No time to cry
Life's you and I
Alive, today

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world we know, up where the clear winds blow

The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your home town
I need some shelter of my own protection baby
To be with myself and center, clarity
Peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal: myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry

The path that I'm walking
I must go alone
I must take the baby steps until I'm full grown (full grown)
Fairytales don't always have a happy ending, do they?
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay

We'll play jacks and Uno cards
I'll be your best friend and you'll be my Valentine
Yes, you can hold my hand if you want to
'Cause I want to hold yours too
We'll be playmates and lovers and share our secret worlds

I'll probably be punished for hard livin blind to the facts
Thugs is convicts in gods prison hand on the strap
Praying to father please forgive me police be rushing when they see me
I flaunted America's most wanted live on TV life
Pleasure and pain stuck in this game holler my name
We all gone die we bleed through similar veins
You'se explain to me now don't panic when my gun burst
Heard the last jam nigga this ones worse
My nigga bone held the chrome till I came home
Thug Luv playas tell these bitch ass niggas bring it on
I caught a plane out to Cleveland late last evening
To help my niggas clean up some niggas no longer breathing now
Who you believe in hit the weed and grieve us. a
Cold ass the world them niggas kill you in your sleep
Until they stop me bury murder me or drop me
I got Thug Luv for my nationwide bustas feel me

[Layzie]
Little thug from the land nigga never ran
Motherfuckers out to get me they don't understand
It's the #1 nigga out with a nation of niggas
Down to put in some work do some dirt
Fuckin round with the band Bone Thugs N Harmony
Follow down the road we stroll to meet karma
Everything I do it seem to cause drama
Ready for the war like a knight in my armor bomb ya
So quick to test us nigga wanna crash me eat dust
For the love of the lust niggas bustin on us
Hit 'em up with he buck 12 gauge erupt it's the Art Of War
Putting niggas on the floor
when I'm comin through the door bringin nothin but terror
Causing much to the nigga that dared us
trying to put a twist in this thugsta
era Paired up with a nigga like Pac
and a nigga like me gotta stay high
Thug Luv till i die keep my prayer to the sky
but I'm still in the hood smoke and fry
So I beg the lord to save us all escapers of misery
Bless my niggas in penitentiaries soldiers of the century

[Krayzie]
Here to get it told my niggas to get the hell down
Down with the dirt and we don't fuck around
Buck a couple of rounds and if you're passing through then hit the ground
And don't get caught up in the crossfire nigga
Artillery thick and you don't want to get to fuckin with this
I'm straight devil devil not a punk and pretend
I reload buck a little more flee the scene
'fore the po-po even know what you lookin for
They don't know a motherfucker with a leatherface hey
Man she said I ran this way said I ran that way
You hoes'll never know because I got away yeah
A criminal mind a nigga on the level sometimes
so get high and analyze your crime
Directly organized with results you'll be surprised

I knew it was ova, that Henny and Cola
Got me like a Soldier

Too strong to lose

This is ten percent luck
Twenty percent skill
15% concentrated power of will
5% pleasure
50% pain
And a 100% reason
To remember the name

Mike!
He doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard
Whether it's the beat or the mike
He feels so unlike
Everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact
That some people still think
That they know him
But fuck 'em
He knows the code
It's not about the salary
It's all about reality
And making some noise
Making the story
Making sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down
Tak's picking it up
Let's go!

Who the hell is he anyway
He never really talks much
Never concerned with status
But still leaving them star struck
Humbled through opportunities
Given to him despite the fact
That many misjudge him
Because he makes a living from writing raps
Put it together himself
Now the picture connects
Never asking for someone's help
Or to get some respect
He's only focused on what he wrote
His will is beyond reach
And now when it all unfolds
The skill of an artist

It's just 20% skill
80% fear
Be 100% clear
Because Ryu is ill
Who would've thought that
He'd be the one to set the west in flames
And I heard him wrecking with
The Crystal Method’s ""Name of the Game""
Came back dropped Megadef
Took them to church
I like ""Bleach"" man
Ryu had the stupidest verse
This dude is the truth
Now everybody be giving him guest spots
His stock's through the roof
I heard he fucking with S Dot

This is 10% luck
20% skill
15% concentrated power of will
5% pleasure
50% pain
And a 100% reason
To remember the name

They call him Ryu the Sick
And he's spitting fire with Mike
Got him out the dryer he's hot
Found him in Fort Minor with Tak
Been a fucking an nihilist porcupine
He's a prick, he's a cock
The type women want to be with
And rappers hope he get shot
Eight years in the making
Patiently waiting to blow
Now the record with
Shinoda's taking over the globe
He's got a partner in crime
His shit is equally dope
You wont believe the kind of shit
That comes out of this kid's throat

Tak!
He's not your everyday on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got
Making his way to the top
People think its a comment on his name
People keep asking him was it given at birth
Or does it stand for an acronym? No
He's living proof
Got him rocking the booth
He'll get you buzzing quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they doing
Give a 100%

Forget Mike
Nobody really knows how or why
He works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note
And he writes every line
And I've seen him at work
When that light goes on in his mind
It's like a design
Is written in his head every time
Before he even touches a key
Or speaks in a rhyme
And those mother fuckers he runs with
Those kids that he signed
Ridiculous, without even trying
How do they do it

15% concentrated power of will
5% pleasure
50% pain

And he's spitting fire with Mike
Got him out the dryer he's hot
Found him in Fort Minor with Tak
Been a fucking an nihilist porcupine
He's a prick, he's a cock
The type women want to be with
And rappers hope he get shot
Eight years in the making
Patiently waiting to blow
Now the record with
Shinoda's taking over the globe
He's got a partner in crime
His shit is equally dope
You wont believe the kind of shit
That comes out of this kid's throat

Tak!
He's not your everyday on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got
Making his way to the top
People think its a comment on his name
People keep asking him was it given at birth
Or does it stand for an acronym? No
He's living proof
Got him rocking the booth
He'll get you buzzing quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they doing
Give a 100%

Forget Mike
Nobody really knows how or why
He works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note
And he writes every line
And I've seen him at work
When that light goes on in his mind
It's like a design
Is written in his head every time
Before he even touches a key
Or speaks in a rhyme
And those mother fuckers he runs with
Those kids that he signed
Ridiculous, without even trying
How do they do it

This is 10% luck
20% skill
15% concentrated power of will
5% pleasure
50% pain
And a 100% reason
To remember the name"

745,1009.0,Frank Sinatra,Lost in the Stars,"Before Lord God made the sea or the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air
For the little dark star in the wind down there
And he stated and promised he'd take special care
So it wouldn't get lost no more

Now, a man don't mind if the stars get dim
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over him
Keeping track how it all goes on

But I've been walking through the night and the day
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
Forgetting his promise and the word he'd say

And we're lost out here in the stars
Little stars big stars blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars
Little stars big stars blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars"

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas,
Just like the ones I used to know.
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow.
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write.
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white."

You were bragging to your friends,

I'm lovin how you look in my eyes, swangin them hips when you pass
I'm visualizin my name tattooed on that ass baby
Jump on this Harley, let's go smoke some of that Bob Marley
Sip some Bacardi then go pull up at the after party
I think we make a perfect couple, but you think I'm trouble
Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number (what?)
She got me feelin like, maybe she the wrong woman
Think I'ma be chasin the chickenhead, you're on somethin
Your toes painted, hair fixed all the time
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you
I betcha I'll have you doin what you said that you won't do
Make a decision shorty, good thangs don't last long
Your girlfriend keeps showin me that thong
Before I head home I'ma stop at your house and blow the horn
If you come outside you know it's on, holla at your boy

[Verse Two: Lloyd Banks]
Now bitches be frustrated with a baller, wonder why I don't call her
Maybe because I'm busy and she need someone to spoil her
It gets annoying, from time to time I gotta ignore her
In order to let her know that we friends and nuttin more
She loves it when I'm in town, hate it when I'm not around
I get her and wear her down, next door neighbors hear the sound
Pictures hittin the ground, just enough to hold us down
I'm stickin and movin, cruisin after the third round
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
I can make a forty-year old feel like a young lady
I admit I fell in love with her friend
And to make her feel special I let her call my by my government name
Her panties wet over fame, fell in love with my chain
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer, would she remain?
Surroundin me, houndin me, tryin to be my ON-LY
I'm not your boyfriend, I'm your HO-MEY

[Chorus]

[Verse Thre: 50 Cent]
Yeah
Don't know what fuck me up more, watchin her lick her lips
Or watchin her walk, she hypnotized me with her hips man
I sweet talk her if she like
Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right, right?
Look, I'm legit now, I used to break laws
Now you can reap the benefits of world tours
Big house, big Benz, girl it's yours
Mink coats, Italian shoes, stones with no flaws
You ain't got ta look like a model for me to adore you
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal
Don't indulge in my past, fuck what happened before you
Cause to me some bunny's gon' hate you that never saw you
C'mere, let me touch on you, I let you touch on me
Put my tongue on you, you put your tongue on me
Let me ride on you and you can ride on

And if you can't be with the one you love
Honey, love the one you're with
Love the one you're with

Love the one you're with

771,1057.0,Gary Jules,Mad World,"All around me are familiar faces, worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for the daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
The tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles it's a very very
Mad World
Mad World

Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday
And they feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen
Sit and listen
Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me
No one knew me
Hello teacher tell me whats my lesson
Look right through me
Look right through me

And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles it's a very very
Mad World

Enlarge your world

772,833.0,Gavin DeGraw,In Love With a Girl,"So many people gonna say that they want you
To try to get you thinking they really care
But there's nothing like the warmth of the one
who has put in the time
and you know he's gonna be there

Backed a border when she knows someone crossed it
Don't let nobody put you down who you're with
Take the pain of protecting your name
from the crutch to the cane to the high wire

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands

And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)

After many broken back doors and windows
Through the valley of the love of the lost
Is a hole that is cut through the souls
Fallen down from the tones
Without reading innuendos

But you found inner peace for the moment
The moment was over in time
Then it's gone, the hit and run
The drifter's run has a short life

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands

And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)

I'mma tell you what you do to thank you
Practice what you preach
Now I know, there's nothing we can't reach

Cause a heart can't erase
Once it finds a place
To be warm and welcome
To be held in shelter

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands

And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
Who knows me better
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me"
773,86.0,George Michael,Amazing,"I was mixed up when you came to me
Too broke to fix said 'daddy what you gone, I'm missing my baby'
Still missing my baby

I was stitched up by the hands of fate
Said how you gonna make it on your own if luck is a lady?
Maybe luck is a lady

I was going down for the third time
My heart was broken, I was not open to your suggestions
I had so many questions
That you just kissed away

Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise
The day you walked in and changed my life
I think it's amazing
The way that love can you set you free

So now I walk in the midday sun
I never thought that my saviour would come
I think it's amazing
I think it's amazing

I think you're amazing

You tried to save me from myself
Said 'darling, kiss as many as you want!
My love's still available
And I now you're insatiable'

We're like victims of the same disease
Look at your big bad daddy and your mom
And your mom... was always acting crazy

I was going down for the third time
My heart was broken, I though that loving you was out of the

Question
Then I say my reflection
Saying please don't let this go

Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise
The day you walked in and changed my life
I think it's amazing
The way that love can you set you free

So now I walk in the midday sun
I never thought that my saviour would come
I think it's amazing
I think you're amazing

Celebrate the love of the one you're with

Celebrate, this life with you baby
I think you should celebrate yeah
Don't put your love in chains baby
No no, walk in the midday sun
I thought I was dreaming
I think it's amazing
I think you're amazing

I said celebrate the love of the one you're with

As this life gets colder
And the devil inside
Tells you to give up

I got plans for us
nights in the scullery
and days instead of me
I only know what to discuss

It's not me you see
pieces of valentine
with just a song of mine
to keep from burning history
seasons of gasoline and gold

Its the sound of the under, sound of the underground

Pumps the bass line up into my brain

To lose their lives out on a limb

And I can die when I'm done

It is so deep
So beautifully liquid

What is this underwater love
I know I don't want anything else

Follow me now
To a place you only dream of
Before I came along
When I first saw you
I was deep in clear blue water
The sun was shining
Calling me to come and see you
I touched your soft skin
And you jumped in with your eyes closed
And a smile upon your face

You come, you go
You come and fall
And come along
'Cause I wanna kiss you in your mouth
Crazy stuff!
Come along
'Cause I wanna kiss you in your mouth
What a tasty mouth

After the rain comes sun
After the sun comes rain again

Fall, fall, and everything falls
Everything falls to overthere and here
To overthere and here
And let's swim
Let's swim so everything's possible

This must be underwater love

Finally, someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing, 'cause I'm countin' no age
Nah, I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare
Intangible, bet you didn't think, so I command you to
Panoramic view, look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you getting down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe, spiritual hero
Who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy?
Lifeless to those, the definition for what life is
Priceless to you, because I put you on the hype shit
You like it? Gun smokin', righteous with one toke
Get psychic among those, possess you with one dose

Allow me to make this childlike in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them, every sproutin' tree, every child of peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise (That's right)
From this fuckin' enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles
But percussion he provides for me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind
That's the inner (Fuck 'em) so I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (Right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing and remember that it's all in your head

In the attic in my mind
And you've been getting by without me
But I've been spending all my time
With a girl that I remember
Who'll never leave or need to grow
Cos when you left you left your memory
Now it's the only thing I know

When the past gives me no comfort
And though the future is the cost
The way I'm choosing to remember
I'll forever be the man I never was

And you, you fade
But the memory remains the same
And I, I can't change
And I think that living with your memory
Is slowly driving me insane

You are perfect but you're empty
And it gets so lonely in my mind
Cos your image in my memory's
The only shred of you that's left behind
You were real but then you left me
And that's the part I can't accept
So I'll keep on living with your memory
Because it's all that I've got left"

When it's not worth dying for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating?

Does the pain weigh out the pride?
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I

When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul

Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I

Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?

When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky

But dad I'm finally thinkin' I may have found the one
Type of girl that will make you way proud of your son

And I know you heard the last song about the girls that didn't last long
But I promise this is on a whole new plane
I can tell by the way she says my name (ba ba da da)

I love it when she calls my phone
She even got her very own ringtone
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is (ba ba da da)

It's gonna be a long drive home but I know as soon as I arrive home
And I open the door take off my coat and throw my bag on the floor
She'll be back into my arms once more for sure

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (ba ba da da)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)

She's got a smile that would make the most senile
Annoying old man bite his tongue
I'm not done
She's got eyes comparable to sunrise
And it doesn't stop there
Man I swear
She's got porcelain skin of course she's a ten
And now she's even got her own song
But movin' on
She's got the cutest laugh I ever heard
And we can be on the phone for three hours
Not sayin' one word
And I would still cherish every moment
And when I start to build my future she's the main component
Call it dumb call it luck call it love or whatever you call it but
Everywhere I go I keep her picture in my wallet like here

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (ba ba da da)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)

Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (ba ba da da)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)"

After all the lies that I made you believe
Guilt kicks in and I start to see
The edge of the bed
Where your nightgown used to be
I told myself I won't miss you
But I remembered
What it feels like beside you
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

While looking through your old box of notes
I found those pictures i took
That you were looking for
If there's one memory I don't want to lose
That time at the mall
You and me in the dressing room
I told myself I won't miss you
But I remembered
What it feels like beside you
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

The bed I'm lying in is getting colder
Wish I never would've said it's over
And I can't pretend I won't think about you when I'm older
Cause we never really had our closure
This can't be the end

Will it start a fight

To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new

I'm sorry that I hurt you
It's something I must live with everyday
And all the pain I put you through
I wish that I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all your tears

Yo I got a fake ID though.
Yeeah, yeeah, yeeah, yo, 2 step with me, 2 step with me.

1, here comes the 2 to the 3 to the 4,
Everybody drunk out on the dance floor,
Baby girl ass jiggle like she want more,
Like she a groupie and I aint even on tour,
Maybe cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore,
Or maybe cause she heard that I buy out the stores,
Bottom of the 9th and a nigga gotta score,
If not I gotta move on to the next whore,
Here comes the 3 to the 2 to the 1,
Homeboy trippin' he don't know I got a gun,
When it come to poppin we do shit for fun,
You aint got one nigga you betta run,
Now I'm in the back gettin head from my hunz,
While she goin down I'm breakin down what I done,
She smokin my blunt sayin she aint havin fun,
Bitch give it back now you don't get none.

[Chorus x4:]
Now everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy,
Everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy.

[Verse 2:]
2, here comes the 3 to the 4 to the 5,
Now I'm lookin at shorty right in the eyes,
Couple seconds passed now I'm lookin at her thighs,
While she tellin me how much she hate her guy,
Said she got a kid but she got her tubes tied,
If you 21 girl that's alright,
I wonder if a shake comin with them fries,
If so baby can I get em super sized,
Here comes the 4 to the 3 to the 2,
She started feelin on my johnson right out the blue,
Girl you super thick so I'm thinkin that's cool,
But instead of 1 lifestyle I need 2
Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels,
Expression on her face like she aint got a clue,
Then she told me she don't run with a crew,
You know how I do but I guess one gotta do.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
3, here comes the 4 to the 5 to the 6,
Self explanatory I ain't gotta say I'm rich,
This single man ain't tryna get hitched,
Liquor wasted on me man son of a bitch,
Brushed it all off now I'm back to gettin lit,
Goose and orange juice man this some good ish ,
Homeboy trippin cause I'm starin at his chick,
Now he on the sideline starin at my clique,
Here comes the 5 to the 4 to the 3,
Hands in the air if you cats drunk as me,
Club on the set Kwon cut out them trees,
Dude I don't care I'm a P.I.M.P.

Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my all ....baby

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other (shit)
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But baby you know the game and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game so bat me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter-past three and shorty's eyein me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I love to see that ass in Gucci shades
Hold down on the bed while I'm yankin your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smackin your ass and fuckin you all wild
[With Ashanti] But we share, somethin so rare, but who cares, you care

(Chorus) x2

(Ja Rule)
Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a ""Dear Ja"" letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money Over Bitches, Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirk with Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparantly fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share [with Ashanti] somethin so rare, but who cares, you care

(Chorus) x2

(Ja Rule)
Oh I'm, feelin like ya livin a, double life
'Cause you don't be comin home, sometimes
Baby, but you're always, on time, checkin for one time
You and I, got a special bond together
We go back like bombers boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play you play the same way you freak me baby I fuck you crazy
Then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
[With Ashanti] But who cares, you care

In the mug and the watch, love me
Half the hoes hate me, half them love me
The ones that hate me only hate me

So many nights at the fireside, how my children's mother would cry
'Cause I told the mother I had to say goodbye

Look over yonder, on the burying ground, on the burying ground
Look over yonder, on the burying ground
Yon' stand ten thousand, standin' still to let me down

So I could see clearly now
The rain has gone

My memory plays out to
The same old song

858,212.0,James Ingram,I Don't Have the Heart,"Your face is beaming
You say it's 'cause you're dreaming
Of how good it's going to be
You say you've been around
And now you've finally found
Everything you wanted and needed in me

I don't have the heart to hurt you
It's the last thing I want to do
But I don't have the heart to love you
Not the way you want me to

Inside I'm dying
To see you crying
How can I make you understand
I care about you
So much about you, baby
I'm trying to say this as gently as I can

'Cause I don't have the heart to hurt you
It's the last thing I want to do
But I don't have the heart to love you
Not the way you want me to

You're so trusting and open
Hoping that love will start
But I don't have the heart, oh, no
I don't have the heart

I don't have the heart to hurt you
It's the last thing I want to do
But I don't have the heart to love you
Not the way THAT you want me to

I don't have the heart (Ooh...)
(Baby, I don't have the heart, I don't have the heart)
I don't have the heart (Ooh...)
(Baby, I don't have)

I don't have the heart
I don't have the heart

859,618.0,James Blunt,Goodbye My Lover,"Did I disappoint you, or let you down?
Should I be feeling guilty, or let the judges frown?
'Cause I saw the end, before we'd begun
Yes, I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won

So I took what's mine by eternal right
Took your soul out into the night
It may be over but it won't stop there
I am here for you, if you'd only care

You touched my heart, you touched my soul
You changed my life and all my goals
And love is blind, but that I knew when
My heart was blinded by you
I've kissed your lips and held your head
Shared your dreams, and shared your bed
I know you well, I know your smell
I've been addicted to you

Goodbye my lover, goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
Goodbye my lover, goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

I am a dreamer, and when I wake
You can't break my spirit
It's my dreams you take
And as you move on, remember me
Remember us and all we used to be
I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile
I've watched you sleeping for a while
I'd be the father of your child
I'd spend a lifetime with you
I know your fears and you know mine
We've had our doubts but now we're fine
And I love you, I swear that's true
I cannot live without you

Goodbye my lover, goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
Goodbye my lover, goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

And I still hold your hand in mine
In mine when I'm asleep
And I will bear my soul in time
When I'm kneeling at your feet

Goodbye my lover, goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
Goodbye my lover, goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

My life is brilliant
My love is pure
I saw an angel
Of that I'm sure
She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan

You're beautiful, You're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

Yes, she caught my eye
As I walked on by
She could see from my face that I was fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last 'til the end

You're beautiful, You're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

You're beautiful, You're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true

With a smile on her face
When she thought up that I should be with you
But it's time to face the truth
I will never be with you"

Of your kisses and your warm embrace, yeah,

You see, man made the cars to take us over the road
Man made the trains to carry heavy loads
Man made electric light to take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water, like Noah made the ark

This is a man's, a man's, a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

Man thinks about a little baby girls and a baby boys
Man makes then happy 'cause man makes them toys
And after man has made everything, everything he can
You know that man makes money to buy from other man

This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

He's lost in the wilderness
He's lost in bitterness"

You meant all the world to me

If, you were on my mind, all night and day, blame it on my youth

Why does it have to be like this?
I can never tell
You make me love you, love you baby
With a little L

There you were shouting out
Cranking up your altercations, getting upset in your desperation
Screaming and hollering
How could this love become so paper thin?

You're playing so hard to get
You're making me sweat just to hold your attention
I can't give you nothing more
If you ain't givin' nothing to me

Don't you know that

you make me love you, love you baby

why does it have to be like this
I can never tell

Seems like you're stepping on the pieces
of my broken shell
'cause you make me love you, love you

From my window I'm staring while my coffee goes cold
Look over there (where?)
There, there's a lady that I used to know
She's married now or engaged or something, so I'm told

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me, there's something going wrong around here

Tonight's the night when I go to all the parties down my street
I wash my hair and I kid myself I look real smooth
Look over there (where?)
There, here comes Jeanie with her new boyfriend
They say that looks don't count for much, if so, there goes your proof

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me, there's something going wrong around here
Around here

But if looks could kill
There's a man there who is marked down as dead
'Cause I've had my fill
Listen you, take your hands from her head
I get so mean around the scene
Hey, hey, hey

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me, there's something going wrong around here
Around here
Something going wrong around here
Something going wrong around here
Something going wrong around here

The boy's gone. The boy's gone home.

What will happen to a face in the crowd when it finally gets too crowded.
And will happen to the origins of sound after all the sounds have sounded
Well I hope I never have to see that day but by god I know it's headed our way
So I better be happy now that the boy's going home. The boy's gone home.

And what becomes of a day for those who rage against it
And who will sum op the phrase for all left standing around in it

Well I suppose we'll all make our judgement call
We'll walk it alone, stand up tall, then march to the fall
So we better be happy now that we'll all go home.

Be so happy with the way you are
Be so happy that you made it this far
Go on be happy now. Please be happy now

Because this is something else
this is something else

I tried to live my life and live it so well
But when it's all over is it heaven or is it hell
I better be happy now that no one can tell, nobody knows
I'm gonna be happy with the way that I am
I'm gonna be happy with all that I stand for
I'm gonna be happy now because the boy's going home.

The boy's gone home."

I know what I did wasn't clever
But me and you were meant to be together

[Hook]
So let me in (let me in) give me another chance (another chance)
To really be your man
Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do
But when I become a star we'll be living so large
I'll do anything for you
So tell me girl

[Chorus]
Mmmm whatcha say, 
Mmm that you only meant well?
Well of course you did
Mmmm whatcha say, (whatcha say, whatcha say)
Mmmm that it's all for the best?

Mmmm whatcha say, (whatcha say, whatcha say)
Wha- wha- wha- wha- what did she say

[Verse 3]
Girl, tell me whatcha said (said) (said)
I don't want you to leave me
Though you caught me cheatin'
Tell me, tell me whatcha said (said) (said)
I really need you in my life
Cause things ain't right, girl
Tell me, tell me whatcha said (said) (said)
I don't want you to leave me
Though you caught me cheatin'
Tell me, tell me whatcha said (said) (said)
I really need you in my life
Cause things ain't right

I left you by the house of fun
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come

When I saw the break of day
I wished that I could fly away
Instead of kneeling in the sand
Catching teardrops in my hand

My heart is drenched in wine
You'll be on my mind
Forever

Out across the endless sea
I would die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road alone

My heart is drenched in wine
You'll be on my mind
Forever

Something has to make you run

I'm out for Dead Presidents to represent me

[Jay-Z]
Well I was fit that wonderama shit
Me and my conglomerate
Shall remain anonymous
Caught up in the finest shit
Live out by dreams until my heart gives out
And while we crave you know exactly what the shit's about
Fuck y'all mean? Handlin' since a teen I dish out
Like the point-guard off your favorite team without doubt
My life ain't rosy but I roll with it
My mind was fine 'till the dough hit it
And told me that the mo' did it
And now it's closer shit and so I said it
I blow a digit on a dimin' in a minute but no bitchin'
Watch how I'm walkin' cause even the thoroughest niggas be knockin',
Tryin' to strike a bargain,
Hopin' that they might get pardoned
Shit on me boy we got me pins and needles
And my cerebral be's the wickedess evil
Thoughts that this boughter feed you
Feed back in a game so deep fien's can catch ya
Freeze off my knee cap can y'all believe that
Got the city drinkin' Crystal raise up the fee
Rappers going broke tryin' to keep up wit me
My rise the riches surprise the bitches
Think harder you know this nigga Jay-Z Shawn Carter
G.S. to fuck up, three years to fuck up
Watch me shine like a brightly be gets to fuck up
All rhymers forget like Alzheimer's
Small timers I said it
I'm addressing all drama torture

[Jay-Z]
So sick of niggas
I want money like Cosby who wouldn't
It's this kind of talk that make me think
You probably ain't got no pudding
Niggas got them kinda dreams from jail
You in the streets nigga
Make your move get your get your mail
Niggas are coastin' the S.L. but can't post bail
Niggas are roast the L.
But scared to throw your toast well
I am here to tell niggas it ain't all swell
There's heaven then there's hell niggas
One day your cruisin' in ya seven
Next day your sweatin' forgetin' your lies
Alibis ain't matchin' up, bullshit catchin' up
Hit with the rico, they repo your vehicle
Everything was all good just a week ago
Bout to start bitchin' ain't you
Ready to start snitchin' ain't you
I forgive your weak ass hustlin' just ain't you
Aside from the fast cars
Hunnies that shake they ass at bars
You know you wouldn't be involved
With the underworld dealers, carriers and mac-miller's
East-coast bodiers, west-coast cap peelers
Little monkey niggas turn gorilla's
Stopped in the station filled up on noctane
And now they not sane, and not playin'
That goes without sayin'
Slangin' day in and day out
With money playin' then they play you out
Tryin' to escape my own mind
Lurkin' the enemy representin' infinite
With presidencies you know

You must be on your guard
And take it slow
And promise me be careful
What you do

I know youre strong
I know you'll make it on your own
Without my help
But please make sure you won't
Be by yourself

Everytime I hear my song
On the radio
I keep moving closer
And closer to you
Everytime the DJ is playing my song
I can feel you here by my side
All night long

You got to try much harder
Take it from the start
And try again
You got to be much faster
If you can

You probably will fail
No matter how you try
It's not enough
It takes so much
To make it to the top

Everytime I hear my song
On the radio
I keep moving closer
And closer to you
Everytime the DJ is playing my song
I can feel you here by my side
All night long

Let's go down
To the dancefloor if you dare
Now's the time
To show that you're not scared"

Then it's, beep beep and I'm pickin em up
Let em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga fist in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head, I'ma break bread

Hoes start pointin - they say, ""There he go!""
Now these motherfuckers know we carry mo' heat than a little bit
We don't pull it out over little shit
And if you catch a lick when I spit, then it won't be a little hit
Go read a book you illiterate son of a bitch and step up yo' vocab
Don't be surprised if yo' hoe stab out with me
and you see us comin down on yo' slab
Livin ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it
But nigga if you hatin I
then you wait while I get yo' bitch butt-naked, just break it
You gotta pay like you weigh wet wit two pairs of clothes on
Now get yo' ass to the back as I'm flyin to the track
Timbaland let me spit my pro's on
Pump it up in the pro-zone
That's the track that we breakin these hoes on
Ain't the track that we flow's on
But when shit get hot, then the glock start poppin like ozone
We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man
Fo' real it don't get no bigger man
Don't trip, let's flip, gettin throwed on the flip
Gettin blowed with the motherfuckin Jigga Man, fool

All the ballers is bouncin they like the way I be leanin
All the rappers be hatin, off the track that I'm makin
But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom the bottom, to the top of the pots

Now fifty-two bars come it, now you feel 'em
Now, fifty-two cars roll out, remove ceiling
In case fifty-two broads come out, now you chillin

At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen

No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real

All of my Dominicano's right there up on Broadway,
Pull me back to that McDonald's, took it to my stashbox, 560 State St.
Catch me in the kitchen like a Simmons wippin' pastry's
Cruisin' down 8th St., off white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas

So they can step out of bounds quick, the sidelines is
Lined with casualties, who sip to life casually
Then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple, Eve
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in style
End of the winter gets cold, en vogue, with your skin out
City of sin, it's a pity on the whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mommy took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
Hail Mary to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien

Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do

He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em
Better them than me, she don't agree with him
She's mad at that, he's not havin that
So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin along
with a flashy nigga braggin on the song
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that
He 2-ways her, so she writes back
Smiley faces after all of her phrases

Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the 8th wonder of the world
The flow of the century.. oh it's timeless.. HOV'!
Thanks for comin out tonight
You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me
I appreciate that.. uuunnnh..

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
Was hurtin 'em in the home of the Terrapins; got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthin 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' sheezy my neezy keep my arms so freezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Haters want me clapped and chromed it ain't easy
Cops wanna knock me, D.A. wanna box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof -- vamoose, son of a bitch!

[Chorus]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A

Not guilty y'all got to feel me

That's the anthem get'cha damn hands UP!

Holla at me...
I do this for my culture
To let 'em know what a nigga look like, when a nigga in a roaster
Show 'em how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry shady it need to be taken over
Label owners hate me I'm raisin the status quo up
I'm overchargin niggaz for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks so talk mo' bucks

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Yeah...
Hov' is back, life stories told through rap
Niggaz actin like I sold you crack
Like I told you sell drugs; no, Hov' did that
so hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the pro-jects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back, sellin they mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner, focused on the ave
Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamp post, why I got my hand closed?
Cracks in my palm, watchin the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail, the two things I hate
Succeed in this rap game, the two things that's great
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
What else can I say about dude, I gets bu-sy

Whether blue or gray be the sky
Whether loud be her cheers or where soft be her tears
More and more do I realise.

I love Paris in the springtime
I love Paris in the fall
I love Paris in the winter when it drizzles
Ooh, I love Paris in the summer when it sizzles.

I love Paris every moment
Every moment of the year
I love Paris, why, why, do I love Paris?
Because my love is near.

How about Germany? Germany?
Achtung! (German-sounding scatting)
Like Chinese?
Ah, Chinese! (Chinese-sounding scatting)
How about Africa? Africa!

Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar

Now what the hell are you waiting for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise
Get 'em, Jay

Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah, hearin' 'me rap is like hearin' G Rap in his prime

I'm, young HO, rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express
Out of the country but the Blueberry still connect

On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand openin', grand closin'
Goddamn your man Hov' cracked the can open again

Who you gon' find doper than him with no pen
Just draw off inspiration
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him
With cheap imitations for these generations

Now can I get an encore, do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waiting for?

After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise
What the hell are you waiting for?

Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you

From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye

When I come back like Jordan, wearin the 4-5
It ain't to play games witchu
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens

Cocksucker take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold out concerts

So muh'fucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore

I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

(I've become so numb)
Can I get an encore, do you want more?
(I've become so numb)
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar

Inside fish sticks, outside tartar sauce
Pocket full of celery, imagine what she tellin me
Blowin on asparagus, the realest shit I ever smoked
Ridin to that Trap or Die, the realest shit I ever wrote

So fresh, so clean, on my way to Charlene

I feel like there's still bitches that owe me sex
I feel like this but niggas don't know the stress
I lost the only girl in the world that know me best
I got the money and the fame and that don't mean shit
I got the Jesus on a chain, man that don't mean shit
Cause when the Jesus pieces can't bring me peace
Yo, I need just at least one of Russell's nieces
On... I let my nightmares go
I put on, everybody that I knew from the go
I know hoes that was frontin when they knew we was broke
They say damn, Yeezy Yeezy, you don't know us no more
You got that big fame homie, and you just changed homie
You can ask big homie, man the top sure lonely
So lonely

Dance on the floor
Nobody's stopping you
Do what you wanna do
Just let the music take control
You can feel it in your soul
Come on and move your body to the groove

Dance the night away
Party till the sun comes up
Go grab a friend
Get on the floor
Come on and dance, dance
Dance with me
DJ if you please

Standing just a little too close to me
You're saying not quite enough to me
You're sipping just a little too slow for me
No doubt, you play it real cool homie
Got me thinking what is it you do for me
Trippin', a little more than I should be
So let yourself go and get right with me

I'm about to sign you up, we can get right

In my heart, in my heart
In my heart, in my heart

Your lips, talking about I play too much
Can't a woman take advantage of what she wants
My hips moving oh so slow
Bar tab looking like a car note
All I need is you here right by my side
Take whatever you want, baby let's ride
And whatever you won't do, let me decide
Just put your name on the dotted line

I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right
We can get right, we can get right
I'm about to fill your cup so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right tonight

So much we got to say
But so little time
And if tonight ain't long enough
Don't leave love behind
(Don't leave this love behind)
Baby, take my hand
I'll show you why

I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right

[Nas]
Uh, this for you girl
Yo, I took you from the projects, put the best clothes in ya closet
Like Ginger from ""Casino"" and now you a pro
We was like Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe
All ya jealous girlfriends hatin' waitin'
So I put the cards in yo hand
All I know is Nas was yo man
It was so real, boats and sixes
Special Japanese chefs makin' home cooked dishes
Plenty trips, invisible sets
You know what you missin'

[Jennifer Lopez]
It's funny coz for a while
I Walked around with a smile
But... deep inside, I could hear
Voices telling me ""This ain't right""
Don't you know, it's not for you
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
Cause I love you I just got to stay

You used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And I know inside that I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)

[Jennifer Lopez]
Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part
I saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize I can't change you

You used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And I know inside that I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)
I said I didn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)

[Jennifer Lopez]
Said I wouldn't walk away
Some days I want to stay (Days I want to stay)
But leaving you is what I need to do (Need to do)
To be OK (I need to be OK)
I never thought it would be true (Would be true)
Me living without you (Living without you)

[Nas]
Huh, this life is crazy

[Jennifer Lopez]
So now it's time for me to make that move

[Nas]
Huh check it
Yo nobody understands me, I'm dealin' with pressure
My peoples is locked in a jail cell with no bail stressin'
Guess it's the life of a kingpin
Rap Stephen King, rock bling
Like neon lights, we gonna be alright
But it's like you feelin' lesser
Claim I'm actin' like a retard
Right me and my boys
We start fights, well will I mature
You scream I'm in the streets all night
Or where was I at, ya found light brown hairs on my hat
I'm slow caught

You used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And I know inside that I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it

Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man

I'll do all that I can

Somewhere I've never been

Made it clear suddenly
The feeling that I can't go on

The dark wind braids the waves.
The crazed birds raid the trees. Is this our destiny?
To join our hands at sea - and slowly sink, and slowly think:
This is perfect water, passing over me.

Do you know Jacques Cousteau when they said on the radio
That he hears bells in random order, deep beneath the perfect water?
Lord, that is frightening, but still so inviting.
To drown inside a sound that lay so far underground.
And to think... And to think:
This is perfect water, passing over me.

To flow inside the spiral tide
To drop my eyes like a bride and ride
Across the curl unmarked by borders
It waits for me like an orphaned daughter
A life of perfect order! A strange and perfect water!
A life of perfect order! A strange and perfect water!

Perfect water.
I dream this dream within my deep and warm Gulf Stream.
Where two blocks of ice melt into my hands like dice,
And I roll (seven) a seven on the floor of the sea! (seven)
And I roll (seven) a seven on the floor of the sea! (seven)
And I feel the perfect water, washing over me.

To flow inside the spiral tide
To drop my eyes like a bride and ride

I need your help
Gotta make this here thing stop

Baby I swear I'll tell the truth
About all the things you used to do
And if you thought you had me fooled
I'm telling you now objection overruled

Here we go, oh baby

One for the money and the free rides it's
Two for the lie that you denied
All rise - all rise
Three for the calls you've been - making it's
Four all the times you've been - faking
All rise - all rise

I rest my case

You're on the stand
With your back against the wall
Nowhere to run
And nobody you can call

I just can't wait
Now the case is open wide
You'll try to pray
But the jury will decide

Baby I swear I'll tell the truth
About all the things you used to do
And if you thought you had me fooled
I'm telling you objection overruled

So step back
Cos you don't know this cat
I know deep down that
You don't want me to react
I'll lay low
Leavin all my options open
The decision of the jury has not been spoken
Step in my house
You find that your stuff is gone
But in reality to whom does the stuff belong
I bring you into court
To preach my order
And you know that - you overstepped the border

One for the money and the free rides it's
Two for the lie that you denied
All rise - all rise
Three for the calls you've been making it's
Four all the times you've been faking
All rise - all rise

What you say
Games you play
What you've done

Here I am alone
How am I holding on
Breathing hardly, need releasing
How am I holding on
Blue sky ends
Rain it clouds my life again, and I know
I'm moving in circles
Nothing can turn me around
Tell everybody
That I must be human after all
All this time is gone
What is right or wrong
One is waiting, two believing
Love is right and wrong
I can't lie here
All I want to feel is right, but I...
I'm moving in circles
Nothing can turn me around
I'm leavin' tomorrow
And I must be human after all"

I know what's happening here

And suddenly it's like a battlefield

One word turns into a war
Why is it the smallest things that tear us down?
My world's nothing when you don't
I'm not here without a shield
Can't go back now

Both hands, tied behind my back with nothing
Oh no, these times when we climb so fast to fall again
Why we gotta fall for it now

I never meant to start a war
You know I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know what we're fighting for

Why does love always feel like a battlefield
A battlefield, a battlefield?
Why does love always feel like a battlefield
A battlefield, a battlefield?

Can't swallow our pride
Neither of us wanna raise that flag
If we can't surrender then we both gonna lose
What we had, oh no

953,1247.0,Jordin Sparks,One Step at a Time,"Hurry up and wait
So close, but so far away
Everything that you've always dreamed of
Close enough for you to taste
But you just can't touch

You wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet
Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it
You know you can if you get the chance
In your face as the door keeps slamming
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated
And you're getting all kind of impatient waiting

(Chorus)
We live and we learn to take
One step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love
It's gonna happen when it's
Supposed to happen that we
Find the reasons why
One step at a time

You believe and you doubt
You're confused, and got it all figured out
Everything that you always wished for
Could be yours, should be yours, would be yours
If they only knew

You wanna show the world, but no one knows your name yet
Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it
You know you can if you get the chance
In your face as the door keeps slamming
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated
And you're getting all kind of impatient waiting

It's gonna happen when it's
Supposed to happen that we
Find the reasons why
One step at a time

When you can't wait any longer
But there's no end in sight (when you need to find the strength)
It's the faith that makes you stronger
The only way you get there
Is one step at a time

Take one step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly

Keep my hand in the fire, sooner or later
I get what I'm asking for
No matter what you say about life, I learn everytime I bleed
That truth is a stranger, my soul is in danger
I gotta let my spirit be free
To admit that I'm wrong, and then change my mind
Sorry, but I have to move on and leave you behind

I can't waste time, so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
Don't need to worry 'bout everything I've done

I'll always have you)

It's not about taking sides
When I looked in the mirror, didn't deliver
It hurt enough to think that I could stop

Still the memory of you
Marks everything I do

They'll fill you up with drugs and booze
Maybe you'll make the evening news

And when you're tripping over your dreams
They'll keep you down by any means
And by the end of the night you'll be stifling your screams

Since you became a VIPerson
It's like your problems have all worsened
Your paranoia casts aspersions
On the truths you know

And they'll just put you in the spotlight
And hope that you'll do alright
Or maybe not

Now Why do you wanna go put starz in their eyes?
Why you wanna go put starz in their eyes?
So why you wanna go put starz in their eyes?
Now why you wanna go put starz in there eyes
Starz in their eyes?

Remember they said you'd show them all
Emphasise the rise but not the fall
And now you're playing a shopping mall

Your mum and dad they can't believe
What you appear to have achieved
While the rest of these users are just laughing in their sleeves

Since you became a VIPerson
It's like your problems have all worsened
Your paranoia casts aspersions
On the truths you know

And now the tabloids use your face
To document your fall from grace
And then they'll tell you that that's just the way it goes
That's just the way it goes

Now why do you wanna go and put starz in their eyes?
It's the same old story well they just didn't realise
And it's a long way to come from the dog and duck karaoke machine
And Saturday night's drunken dreams

Now why do you wanna go and put starz in their eyes?
It's the same old story but they just didn't realise
And it's a long way to come from your private bedroom dance routines
And Saturday night's drunken dreams

Now why do you wanna go and put starz in their eyes?
Why do you wanna go and put starz in their eyes?
So why do you wanna go and put starz in their eyes?
Now why do you wanna go and put starz in their eyes?
Starz in their eyes?

Now why do you wanna go and put starz in their eyes?
It's the same old story but they just didn't realise
And it's a long way to come from the dog and duck karaoke machine

She's freaky and I like it

Listen

She grabs the yellow bottle
She likes the way it hits her lips
She gets to the bottom
It sends her on a trip so right
She might be goin' home with me tonight

She looks like a model
Except she's got a little more ass
Don't even bother
Unless you've got that thing she likes
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
Man I swear she's bad and she knows
I think that she knows

She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky, but I like it

She shuts the room down
The way she walks and causes a fuss
The baddest in town
She's flawless like some uncut ice
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight

And all she wants is to dance
That's why you'll find her on the floor
But you don't have a chance
Unless you move the way that she likes
That's why she's goin' home with me tonight

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare

Unless you've got that thing she likes
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
Man I swear she's bad and she knows
I think that she knows

She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky, but I like it

She shuts the room down
The way she walks and causes a fuss
The baddest in town
She's flawless like some uncut ice
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight

And all she wants is to dance
That's why you'll find her on the floor
But you don't have a chance
Unless you move the way that she likes
That's why she's goin' home with me tonight

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
Man I swear she's bad and she knows
I think that she knows

Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned from everywhere
She's bad and she knows
I think that she knows



Now dance
Get it girl girl
You're freaky, but I like it
Hot damn!
Let me put my funk on this one time

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned

The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned from everywhere
She's bad and she knows

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
Man I swear she's bad and she knows
I think that she knows

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
I think I'm love stoned
She's got me love stoned

I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh [repeat 2 more times]

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
I'm love stoned from everywhere and she knows
I think that she knows
Think that she knows, oh, oh

And now I walk around without a care
She's got me hooked
It just ain't fair, but I...
I'm love stoned and I could swear
That she knows
Think that she knows, oh, oh
She knows, she knows, oh, oh"

There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
'Cause when I was barely livin, that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some lee way on the he say she say
You girl don't like me, how long has she been gay
Spanish girls say No able ingle
And everybody want to run to me for their single
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dog, If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself
Dog, If I was you, I wouldn't hurt myself
Made a mill myself, and I'm still myself
And I'm a look in the mirror if I need some help
Ask me from the heart, y'all all frontin
Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel somethin

Why you come here, I bet it only it was forget to get you

Get arrested, guess until, they get the message.
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny,

You know I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it.

Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......

Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid,
Seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived, cuz
It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe does
he write his own rhymes, so sort of
I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought up
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder
so its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
- its for yourself that's important
If you're a stripper named Porscha and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me,
That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because

I was sick about awards
Couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them
30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them
What more could you ask for?
The international assholes nah
Who complains about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame,
When he came, in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
Its Kanye - But some of my plaques - they still say Kane
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
My father Ben said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my ceaser
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic

You know who you can call you gotta best believe it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit sound like the best of
A&amp;amp;R's lookin' like &amp;quot;pssh we messed up&amp;quot;
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'till we got messed up
In the studio, where really though, yea he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog &amp;quot;Yo, where Dame at?&amp;quot;
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
&amp;quot;What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?&amp;quot;
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
R-r-r-right here stands a-man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands...

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......

My best friend say she use to fuck wit Usher
I dont care what none of yall say, I still love her

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
18 years, 18 years
She got one of yo kids got you for 18 years
I know somebody payin child support for one of his kids
His baby momma car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Superbowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was s'pose to buy you shorty TYCO with your money
She went to the doctor got lypo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Should of got that insured GEICO for your money
If you aint no punk
holla 'We Want Prenup' 'WE WANT PRENUP! Yeaah!'
It's something that you need to have
Cause when she leave your ass she gone leave with half
18 years, 18 years
And on her 18th birthday he found out it wasn't his

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Now I ain't sayin you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You got out to eat and he can't pay, ya'll cant leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But why ya'll washin' watch him
He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look in his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So, stick by his side
I know his dude's ballin, but yeah thats nice
And they gone keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right girl
And when you get on, he leave your ass for a white girl

Get down girl gone head get down
Get down girl gone head get down
get down girl gone head get down
get down girl gone head."

While getting' some brain
Whipped it out, she said ""I never seen snakes on a plane""
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get izz
Having money's the everything that having' it is
I was splurging' on trizz
But when I get my card back activated
I'm back to Vegas cause
I always had a passion for flashing' before I had it
I close my eyes and imagine, the good life

Is the good life better than the life I live
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmama ain't the only girl calling me baby
And if you feeling' me now then put your hands up in the sky

Im coming home again
Do you think about me now and then? Yea
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again, coming home again


I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I love most, she had so much soul
She said ""Excuse me little homie, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Wendy [windy], and
I like to blow trees"" and
From that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tell 'em off
And make 'em straighten up they hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she show me how to go downtown
And in the nighttime, her face lit up, so astound
And I told her, in my heart is where she'll always be
She never mess with entertainers cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV, and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said ""keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me""

Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again, coming home again

Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then? Ohh
Oh, now I'm coming home again
Maybe we could start again.

But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport, to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you, and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do, just not new""
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'till it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that, when I was back home
Every interview I'm representing you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars, so if you fall you land on a cloud
Jumpin' a crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-town

Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?

I know He hear me when my feet get weary
Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models we rap we don't think
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheist into believers
I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers
The way Kathy Lee needed Regis that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dawg radio needs this
They said you can rap anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk bout God my record won't get played
Huh?
Well if this take away from my spins
Which will probably take away from my ends
Then I hope it take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin 'bout
Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out...

God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down

The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now.

Yo G they can't stop me from rapping can they?

Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now man
It's your boy Kayne titter....
Chi-Town what's going on man

I drink a boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dizzert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man bizerk
Not to worry the Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back wizzork
How do you console my mom or give her light support
When you telling her your sons' on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmit Till
She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine
She a delta so she been throwing them dynasty signs
I'm use to trying to reline
I been trying to be sign
Trying to be a millionaire
How I use two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died

Looked in the mirror half my jaw was missing and half my mouth
I couldn't believe it
But im still here for yall right now yo
This is what I gotta say yo
Yeah, turn me up yeah

(Verse 2)
What if somebody from the Chi-town was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
Except he really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, Bad night, Right place, Wrong time
In the blink of an eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mase felt

I look Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky
it was televised
There`s been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must gotta angel
Cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still wont grow up, I'm a grown ass kid

Back when they thought pink polos would hurt the Roc,
Before Cam got the shit to pop, the doors was closed.
I felt like Bad Boy's street team, I couldn't work the Lox.
Now let's go.
Take 'em back to the plan...
Me and my mama hopped in the U-Haul van.
Any pessimists I ain't talk to them,
Plus, I ain't have no phone in my apartment.
Let's take 'em back to the club.
Least about an hour I would stand on line,
I just wanted to dance.
I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance.
I just wanted to shine.
Jay's favorite line: ""Dog, in due time""
Now he look at me, like ""Damn, dog, you where I am""
A hip hop legend,
I think I died in an accident, cause this must be heaven.

Back when Gucci was the shit to rock,
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop,
I would do anything to say ""I got it,""
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket.
Before anybody wanted K-West beats,
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC.
Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns,
Like ""Man, these niggas that much better than me?""
Baby, I'm going on an aeroplane,
And I don't know if I'll be back again.
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets,
But when she came to kick it, things became different.
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on.
I couldn't keep it home, I thought I needed a Nia Long.
I'm trying to write my wrongs,
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song.
Now,

Peach fuzz buzz but been on the verge

But, before you say another word,
I'm back on the block like a man on the street.
I'm trying to stop lyin' like I'm Mumm-Ra,
But I'm not lying when I'm laying on the beat.

But I still feel as possessed as a gun charge.

In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car.
So, I represent the first.

Yet feel the air beneath my feet?
How can happiness feel so wrong?
How can misery feel so sweet?
How can you let me watch you sleep,
Then break my dreams the way you do?
How can I have got in so deep?
Why did I fall in love with you?

This is the closest thing to crazy I have ever been
Feeling twenty-two, acting seventeen,
This is the nearest thing to crazy I have ever known,
I was never crazy on my own:
And now I know that there's a link between the two,
Being close to craziness and being close to you.

How can you make me fall apart
Then break my fall with loving lies?
It's so easy to break a heart;
It's so easy to close your eyes.
How can you treat me like a child
Yet like a child I yearn for you?
How can anyone feel so wild?
How can anyone feel so blue?

This is the closest thing to crazy I have ever been
Feeling twenty-two, acting seventeen,
This is the nearest thing to crazy I have ever known,

Lost my discretion

Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
Your my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what, good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

Us girls we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

I kissed a girl and I liked it

Where there is cheese there are rats, Where ever there are rats there are cats, Where ever there are cats there are dogs, If you got the dogs you got bitches, bitches always out to put their paws on your riches, If you got riches, you got glitches, If you got glitches in your life computer turn it off and then reboot it, now you back on, Can't just put the cap on the old bottle once you pop it that'll spoil it, gone and drink it and enjoy it.
Mama I'm a millionaire.

Kelis:
What's a girl to do when she just has dimes not time just play-yay-yay-yay.
What's a girl to do instead of me it's you'll be true-woo-woo-woo.
What's a girl to do in a world of greed but kneel and pray-yay-yay-yay.
What's a girl to do when she's lost her long time friends that's lie-ie-ie-ife.

Andre 3000: I-I'm feeling sad, like a million bucks. I-I-I-I-I-I'm feelin' sad, like a million. I-I-I'm feelin' sad, like a million. Sad. Like a million. I-I-I-I-I-I'm feelin' sad. (fade)(fade)"

I used to stand so tall, I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight, everything it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong
Now I can´t breathe, no I can´t sleep
I’m barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I’m torn into pieces, can´t deny it, can´t pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won´t get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

I told you everything, opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright, for once in my life
Now all that’s left of me, is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside

Cause I can’t breathe, no I can’t sleep
I’m barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I’m torn into pieces, can´t deny it, can´t pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I’ve cried
Behind these hazel eyes

Swallow me, then spin me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you, it kills me now
No, I don’t cry on the outside anymore
Anymore

Here I am, once again
I’m torn into pieces, can´t deny it, can´t pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry

Miss ""If you wanna use that line you better not start"", no

She didn't wanna end up jaded

By changing her misconceptions
She went in a new direction
And found in time she felt a connection
She fell... in love

No time for love that came her way
She looked in the mirror and thought today
What happened to Miss No Longer Afraid?
It took some time for her to see
How beautiful love could truly be
No more talk of ""why can't that be me""

Reading books about science and smart stuff
It's not enough, no
Cause smart dont make you cool, whoa

He's not invisible anymore
With his Father's 9 and a broken fuse
Since he walked through that classroom door
He's all over primetime news

As Marilyn Monroe
She put her fingers in the imprints
at Mann's Chinese Theatre show
She coulda been a movie star
Never got the chance to go that far
Her life was stole

No no no no oh

They were cryin' to the camera
Said he never fitted in
He wasn't welcome
He showed up to the parties
They was hanging in
Some guys were puttin' him down
Bullying him round round
Now I wish I woulda talked to him
Gave him the time of day
Not turn away
If I woulda been the one to maybe go this far
He might have stayed at home
Playing angry chords on his guitar

He's not invisible anymore
With his baggy pants and his legs in chains
Since he walked through that classroom door
Everybody knows his name

But my truth held so many little lies
Can turn the page, can rearrange, it's written in the sand
And the tide is closing in

I see your dirty face
High behind your collar
What is done in vain
Truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God
To justify the way you live a lie
Live a lie
Live a lie

And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well you made your bed
I'm in mine

(Chorus)
Because when I arrive
I, I bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What is this, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock

(Verse 2: Kevin Rudolph)
Now the son's disgraced
He, who knew his father
When he cursed his name
Turned, and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger
To the world
To the world
To the world

And you take your time
And you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours
I got mine

(Chorus...)

Yeah!
Wayne's world
Planet Rock
Panties drop
And the tops
And she gunna rock 'til the camera stop

And Samantha (rock)
And Amanda (rock)
And Tamara (rock)

I'm in here like bitch what's up
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can dick you up
I can dick you down
Shorty we can go wherever just pick a town
And the jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big ass rocks like off the ground
Dirty like socks thats on the ground
Weezy

Just Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock

Im back like I forgot somethin

And I wish I could say

It is the night of the dear Savior's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining,
Till He appear'd and the soul felt its worth.

For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.

Oh night divine, Oh night when Christ was born;
Oh night divine, Oh night, Oh night Divine.

Oh you get me ready
In your '56 Chevy
Why don't we go sit down in the shade
Take shelter on my front porch
The dandilion sun scorching
Like a glass of cold lemonade

I will do the laundry
If you pay all the bills
Where is my John Wayne
Where is my prairie song
Where is my happy ending
Where have all the cowboys gone

Why don't you stay the evening
Kick back and watch the T.V.
And I'll fix a little something to eat
Ohh I know your back hurts
From working on the tractor
How do you take your coffee my sweet

I will raise the children
If you pay all the bills
Where is my John Wayne
Where is my prairie song
Where is my happy ending
Where have all the cowboys gone

I am wearing my new dress tonight
But you don't, but you don't even notice me
Say our goodbyes
Say our goodbyes
Say our goodbyes

We finally sell the Chevy
When we had another baby
And you took that job in Tennessee
You made friends at the farm
And you join them at the bar
Almost every single day of the week

I will wash the dishes
While you go have a beer
Where is my John Wayne
Where is my prairie song
Where is my happy ending
Where have all the cowboys gone
Where is my Marlboro Man
Where is his shiny gun
Where is my lonely ranger
Where have all the cowboys gone

Where have all the cowboys gone

Where have all the cowboys gone"

Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

When I give my heart it will be completely
Or I'll never give my heart
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I fall in love with you.

And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too

How could you do this to me?

I’m sure you’ll get what you deserve.

I don’t want to be the one who signed.
I’m not the one who falls down,

Try to forget it.

Living my life in a slow hell
Different girl every night at the hotel
I ain't seen the sun shine in three damn days
Been fuelin' up on cocaine and whiskey
Wish I had a good girl to miss me
Lord I wonder if I'll ever change my ways

I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you
While I'm lying next to her
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her

oooooooooooo

SHERYL CROW
I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone knows but they won't tell
But their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right
I've been waitin on you for a long time
Fueling up on heartaches and cheap wine
I ain't heard from you in three damn nights

I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him

oooooooooo

I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him

oooooooooo

I saw you yesterday with an old friend

KID ROCK
It was the same old same how have you been

BOTH
Since you've been gone my world's been dark and grey

KID ROCK
You reminded me of brighter days

SHERYL CROW
I hoped you were coming home to stay
I was headed to church

KID ROCK
I was off to drink you away

BOTH
I thought about you for a long time
Can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't understand why we're living life this way

I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you to come back home
ooooooooo
I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you
To come back home

But I ain't fallin' down bro (no, no, no)
I won't lose control bro (no, no, no)
Shackle and chained
My soul feels stained
I can't explain got an ich on my brain
Lately my whole aim is to maintain
And regain control of my mainframe
My bloods boiling its beatin' out propaine
My train of thoughts more like a runaway train
I'm in a fast car drivin' in a fast lane
In the rain and I just might hydroplane

I don't fear none of my enemies
And I don't fear bullets from uzis
I've been dealing with something thats worse than these
That'll make you fall to your knees and thats the
The anxiety the sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoias brought me to my knees
Lord please please please
Take away my anxiety
The sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoias brought me to my knees
Lord please please please
Take away my anxiety

My head keeps running away my brother
The only thing making me stay my brother
But I won't give into it bro (no, no, no)

Tell my enemy is my own
Gots to find my inner wealth
Gots to hold up my thoughts
I can't get caught (no, no, no)
I can't give into it now (no, no, no)
Emotions are trapped set on lock
Got my brain stuck goin through the motions
Only I know what's up
I'm filled up with pain
Tryin' to gain my sanity
Everywhere I turn its a dead end infront of me
With nowhere to go gotta shake this anxiety
Got me feelin' strange paranoia took over me
And its weighin' me down
And I can't run any longer, yo
Knees to the ground

So I'm gonna let it do all the talking.

I came across a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree.

I felt a little fear, upon my back
I said, ""Don't look back, just keep on walking.""

He said, ""Hey lady, will you marry me?""

No, no, no, no.

And my heart had a problem, in the early hours,
So I stopped it dead for a beat or two.
(woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
But I cut some cord, and I shouldn't have done that,
And it won't forgive me after all these years
(woo-hoo, woo-hoo)

So I sent it to a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree.

Now It won't come back, cause it's oh so happy
And now I've got a hole for the world to see

I had my hopes out on the line
Ouuhh will they be ready for you in time
If you leave them out too long
Ouuhh they'll be withered by the sun
Full stops and exclamation marks
Ouuhh my words stumble before I start
How far can you send emotions?
Ouuhh can this bridge cross the ocean?

I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
(Repeat)

Let's go on to make me
Let's be cool to creating
Up in darkness we can see
And you're not blind for the light from me

I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand"

If you were king you'd set me free
But I'd be too dumb
Well I'd be too dumb to ever leave

Sometimes it is good
Sometimes it's as bad as it could be
Sometimes it's lost
And sometimes it's right in front of me

I love it, I hate it, I feel like a whore
I give it, I take it, I come back for more
I build it, I break it, I even the score

I thank you for the war
I thank you for the hollywood ending
Give thanks for it all
Cause life's not as easy as it seems

Sometimes it's a rose
And sometimes the smell is sobering
Sometimes it's a mouse
And sometimes the sound is deafening

I love it, I hate it, I feel like a whore
I give it, I take it, I come back for more
I build it, I break it, I even the score

It feels like it beats you up


It feels like it knocks you out
feels like a kiss on the mouth

It feels like the saddest song
Nothing can stop us now
Feels like a kiss on the mouth

I love it, I hate it, I feel like a whore
I give it, I take it, I come back for more
I build it, I break it, I even the score
I love it, I hate it, I feel like a whore
I give it, I take it, I come back for more

I just get tangled in the sheets.
I swim in sweat 3 inches deep.
Just lay back and claim defeat.

Chapter read and lesson learned.
I turn the lights off while she burned.
So, while she's three hundred degrees,
I throw the sheets off and I freeze.

Lids down, I count sheep,
I count heartbeats.
The only thing that counts is
That I won't sleep.
I countdown, I look around.

Who needs sleep?
(Well, you're never gonna get it.)
Who needs sleep?
(Tell me what's that for?)
Who needs sleep?
(Be happy with what you're getting,
There's a guy's been awake since the Second World War.)

(Well, you're never gonna get it.)
Who needs sleep?
(Tell me what's that for?)
Who needs sleep?
(Be happy with what you're getting,
There's a guy's been awake since the Second World War.)

My hands are locked up tight in fists.
My mind is racing, filled with lists
Of things to do and things I've done.
Another sleepless night's begun.

Lids down, I count sheep,
I count heartbeats.
The only thing that counts is
That I won't sleep.
I countdown, I look around.

So much joy in life, so many pleasures all around.
But the pleasure of insomnia is one I've never found.
With all life has to offer there's so much to be enjoyed.
But the pleasures of insomnia are ones I can't avoid.

Lids down, I count sheep,
I count heartbeats.

All of the people start to rush, start to rush by
A dizzy twister dance. Can't find my drink or man.
Where are my keys? I lost my phone, phone

What's going on on the floor?

And I ain't gonna' give it up, steady trying to pick it up like a call [hey]
I'm gonna hit it, I'm gonna beat it up latch onto it until tomorrow yeah.

Shawty I can see that you got so much energy
The way you're twirlin' up them hips 'round and 'round
And now there's no reason at all why you can't leave here with me
In the meantime stay and let me watch you break it down

And dance, gonna be okay, da doo doo

on the spot always around twelve,

I've always needed something
But I've got all I want
When it comes to loving you
You're my only reason
You're my only truth

Like breath, like rain
I need you like mercy
From heaven's gate
There's a freedom in your arms
That carries me through
I need you

You're the hope that moves me
To courage again
You're the love that rescues me
When the cold winds, rage
And it's so amazing
'Cause that's just how you are
And I can't turn back now
'Cause you've brought me too far

I need you like water
Like breath, like rain
I need you like mercy
From heaven's gate

I heard a cry within my soul
I've never had a yearning quite like this before
Now here you are walking right through my door.

All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

A sacred gift of heaven
For better, worse, wherever
And I would never let somebody break you down
Or take your crown never

All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

I've searched through time
I've always known
That you were there upon your throne
A lonely queen without her king
I've longed for you my love forever

Where have you been

Don't need no credit card to ride this train

Away from here

Light up, light up

To think I might not see those eyes
Makes it so hard not to cry
And as we say our long goodbyes

You know we had to do it again, right?

[Lil' Jon]
We had to do it again,
Want you to sing to these ladies, man

A'ight, so I'm up first? A'ight, lemme have it...
(Ohh-oh-oh-ohh)
Let's do it...

[1st Verse - Usher]
Baby, how ya doin'?
Hope that 'cha fine, wanna know what you got in mind tonight,
Got me feenin' like Jodeci, girl, I can't leave you alone,
Take a shot of this here Petrone' and it's gon' be on,
V.I.P. room got way too crowded,
I'm about to end up callin' it a night,
You should holla at 'cha girl, tell her you shakin' the scene,
Pull off, beep-beep, shotgun in the GT with me
She said, ""Ohhh-ohhh, I'm ready to ride, I was like yeah,""
""'Cause once you get inside, you can't change your mind,""
""Don't mean to sound impatient, but you gotta promise, baby, ohh...""

[Chorus - Usher]
Tell me again (Tell me again, my baby),
That we'll be Lovers and Friends (Ohh, I gotta know, baby, aw yeah)
Tell me again (Make sho' your right, ohh, before we leave),
That we'll be Lovers and Friends (Ohh, oh it's a good look, baby)...

[2nd Verse - Ludacris]
Sometime I wanna be your lover,
Sometime I wanna be your friend,
Sometime I wanna hug ya,
Hold hands, slow-dance while the record spins,
Opened up your heart 'cause you said I made you feel so comfortable,
Used to play back then, now you all grown-up like Rudy Huxtable,
I could be your bud, you could beat me up,
Play-fight in the dark, then we both make love,
I'd do anything just to feel your butt,
Why you got me so messed up?
I don't know, but you gotta stop trippin',
Be a good girl now, turn around, and get these whippings,
You know you like it like that,
You don't have to fight back,
Here's a pillow - bite...that,
And I'll be settin' seperate plays,
So on all these separate days,
Your legs can go they separate...ways...

[Chorus - Usher]
Tell me again (Tell me again, my baby),
That we'll be Lovers and Friends (Ohh, it's a good look, baby)
Tell me again (Tell me over-and-over-and-over again),
That we'll be Lovers and Friends (Make sho' you right, before you choose)...

[3rd Verse - Lil' Jon]
I's been know you fo' a long time (shorty'),
But fuckin' never crossed my mind (shorty'),
But tonight, I seen sumthin' in ya (shorty),
That made me wanna get wit 'cha (shorta'),
but You ain't been nuttin' but a friend to me (shorty'),
And a nigga never ever dreamed to be (shorty'),
Up in here, kissin', huggin', squeezin', touchin' (shorty'),
Up in the bathtub, rub-a-dubbin' (shorty'),
Are you sure you wanna go this route? (shorty'),
Let a nigga know before I pull it out (shorty'),
I would never ever cross the line (shorty'),
Shorta'let me hear you tell me one mo' time...one mo' time...

The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathin a sniper's death
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shinin', sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a uzi on the island in my army jacket linin
Hit the Earth like a comet, invasion
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazin
Cause in my physical, I can express throuh song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drank Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell

The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Nas, stories by Aesop, place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el
Inhale from the L, school a fool well, you feel it like braille
It ain't hard to tell, I kick the skill like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills I'm Ill
plus Matic, I freak beats slam it like Iron Shiek
Jam like a tech with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin while you're plannin ways to sabatoge me
I leave em froze like her-on in your nose
Nas'll rock well, it ain't hard to tell

This rhythmatic explosion, is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggaz is frozen
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep well let me try again
Wisdom be leakin out my grapefruit troop
I dominate break loops, givin mics men-e-straul cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groovy but smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stallone in Cobra
Packin like a rasta in the weed spot
Vocals'll squeeze glocks, MC's eavesdropT
Though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas's raps should be locked in a cell
It ain't hard to tell"

May end up with red spots
When it's hot, then it's hot
If it's ain't, then it's not
Wait, you walk over

I can't hardly see
If this keeps goin' on
I might just leave and not come back
I got one foot in your doorway
I got one foot on the path

Well you beg me to stay
Then you order me to go
All this up and down
Is wear and tear on my soul
I'm wonderin' if our future
Is gonna look just like our past
I got one foot in your doorway
I got one foot on the path

Now I love you, baby
Don't get me wrong
But this heart of mine
May not be that strong
You got me on your line
Reel me in or throw me back
I got one foot in your doorway
I got on foot on the path

You'd best thing about it, baby
But don't take too long
If we can't get it right

Cause I don't write shit cause I ain't got time,
Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar,
And the almighty power of dat cha cha cha cha chopper,

You can't man em then you mop em,
You can't stand em then you drop em,
You pop em cause we pop em like Orville Redenbacher

'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately

Does anybody really know the secret
Or the combination for this life and where they keep it
It's kinda sad when you don't know the meaning
But everything happens for a reason
I don't even know what I should say
'Cause I'm an idiot, a loser, a microphone abuser
I analyze every second I exist
Beaten on my mind every second with my fist

Everybody wanna run (run)
Everybody wanna hide from the gun (gun)
You can take a ride through this life if you want
But you can't take that edge off that knife (no sir)
And now you want your money back (money back)
But your denied 'cause your brains fried from the sack
And there ain't nothing I can do
'Cause life is a lesson you'll learn it when your through

I know why you want to hate me
I know why you want to hate me
I know why you want to hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has ever seen lately
I know why you want to hate me
I know why you want to hate me
Now I know why you want to hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has ever seen lately
Now you want to hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has ever seen lately
Now you wanna hate me

Now I know why...

Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fuckin' mind
Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Truth is you can stop and stare
Run myself out, and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere
Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

I bleed it out, go, stop the show
Choppy words and a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go
Mama help me, I've been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Can't contain him, he knows he works
... this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied
So why try ignoring him?
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out, I've opened up these scars
I'll make you face this
I pull myself so far
I'll make you face, this, now

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

I bleed it out
I bleed it out
I bleed it out."
1168,236.0,Linkin Park,Breaking the Habit,"Memories consume like opening the wounds
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
Because inside I realize that I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I know, it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit, I'm breaking the habit tonight

Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more than any time before
I had no options left again

I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
Because inside I realize that I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way I’ll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit, I'm breaking the habit tonight

I'll paint it on the walls
Because I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again
And this is how it ends

I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way I’ll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit, I'm breaking the habit

Do you think it's worth holding out?
I mean I heard some pretty ugly things about those guys
Ugly stories

Watch them flee
Watch them flee
Wrap-up
Watch them flee
Hip-Hop hits
And you do it like this


It's goin' down
The rhythm projects 'round the next sound
Reflects the complex hybrid dialect now
Detect the mesh of many elements compressed down
The melting pot of a super-futuresque style
The combination of a vocal caress
With lungs that gasp for breath
From emotional stress
With special effects
And a distorted collage
Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage

Chorus:
It's goin' down
The logical progression on a timeline
The separation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly
Take you on an audible odyssey
Now it's goin' down

The separation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly
Take you on an audible odyssey
Now it's goin' down


Put put put it up
And it goes like this
And you do it like this
It's goin' down

Once again it is
Composed sentences all together venomous
The four elements of natural force
Projected daily through the sound of the source
Everybody on board with this blend
The sword with the pen
The mightiest of weapons
Swinging right from the chin
The elevate of mental states
Long gone with the wind
To defend men for shoddy imitation pretends
It's going down
Style assimilation readily
Trekking through the weaponry
Of a pure pedigree
Cleverly seeing through whatever is ahead of me
Whatever the weather be
We advancin' steadily
It's going down to sub-terrestrial high
I rhyme regiment that's calling the shots
Execution of collaborative plots
Ready to bring the separation of style to a stop

Chorus:
It's going down
A logical progression on a timeline
The separation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly
Take you on an audible odyssey
Now, it's going down

Put put put it up
And it goes like this
And you do it like this
It's goin' down


X-men 'bout to blast off world wide
X-men 'bout to blast off world wide
And you do it like this
'Bout to blast off world wide


It's going down
Put put put it up
And it goes like this
And you do it like this
It's going down
Put put it up
And it goes like this
And you do it like this
It's going down

As time began to blur
Like a startling sign
That fate had finally found me

That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide

There was nothing inside
The memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Across this new divide

In every loss in every lie
In every truth that you deny
And each regret and each goodbye
Was a mistake too great to hide
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean

Holding too tightly
afraid to lose control,

Has fallen apart

No rapper can rap quite like I can
I'll take a musclebound man and put his face in the sand
Not the last Mafioso I'm a MC cop,
Make you say, ""Go L.L. and do the wop""

If you think you can outrhyme me, yeah boy I bet
Cause I ain't met a motherfucker who can do that yet
Trendsetter I'm better my rhymes are good
I got a gold name plate that says I wish you would

And when rap begin then I gotta join in and
Before my rhyme is over you know I'm a win
Cool J has arrived so you better make way
Ask anybody in the crowd they say the kid don't play!

Sparring competition that's my hobby and job

Because I'm bad as can be got my voice on wax
Some brothers think he's making records now he must have relaxed

I couldn't shouldn't and it'll stay that way
The best rapper you've heard is L.L. Cool J
Kamikaze take a look at what I've done
Used to rock in my basement now I'm number one

And can happen on time never standin' on lime
You wanna try me first you better learn how to rhyme
I'm the pinnacle that means I reign supreme
And I'm notorious I'll crush you like a jelly bean

I eliminate punks cut 'em up in chunks
You were souped you heard me and your ego shrunk
I'm devastating I'm so good it's a shame
Cause I eat rappers like a cannibal they call me insane

I'm as strong as a bull of course you know I am pull
I enjoy what I'm doing plus I'm paid in full
Not Buckaroo Bonsai but busted out as I
Say the kind of rhymes that make MC's wish that I died

Never retire or put my mike on the shelf
The baddest rapper in the history of rap itself
Not bitter or mad just provin' I'm bad
You want a hit give me a hour plus a pen and a pad

MC's they retreat cause they know I can beat 'em
And eat 'em in a battle and the ref won't cheat 'em

1181,1053.0,LL Cool J,I Need Love,"When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
and in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call
Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove
For the first time in my life I see I need love
There I was, giggling about the games
That I had played with many hearts and I'm not saying no-names
Then the thought occurred, tear drops made my eyes burn
As I said to myself ""Look what you've done to her""
I can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels
All I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal
Playing make believe pretending that I'm true
Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you
Sayin' amour kissing you on the ear
Whispering I love you and I'll always be here
Although I often reminisce I can't believe that I found
A desire for true love floating around
Inside my soul because my soul is cold
One half of me deserve to be this way 'til I'm old
But the other half needs affection and joy
And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy

I need love

Romance, sheer delight how sweet
I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete
You can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle
I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle
I'll give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat
Kiss you on the cheek and say ""Ooh girl, you're so sweet""
It's deja vu whenever I'm with you
I could go on forever tellin' you what I do
But where you at, you're neither here nor there
I swear I can't find you anywhere
Damn sure you ain't in my closet or under my rug
This love search is really making me bug
And if you know who you are why don't you make yourself seen
Take a chance with my love you'll find out what I mean
Fantasies can run, but they can't hide
When I find you I'm a pour all my love inside

I need love

I wanna kiss you, hold you, never scold you, just love you
Suck on your neck, caress you and rub you
Grind moan and never be alone
if you're not standing next to me You're on the phone
Can't you hear it in my voice? I need love bad
I got money, but love is something I never had
I need your ruby red lips sweet face and all
I love you more than a man who's ten feet tall
I'd watch the sunrise in your eyes
We're so in love when we hug, we become paralyzed
Our bodies explode in ectasy unreal
You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel
It's like a dream-land I can't lie, I've never been there
Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share
Clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet
I swear to you this is something I'll never forget

I need love

See what I mean I've changed I'm no longer
A playboy on the run I need something that's stronger
Friendship, trust, honor, respect, admiration
This whole experience has been such a revelation
It taught me love and how to be a real man
To always be considerate and do all I can
Protect you, you're my lady and you mean so much
my body tingles all over from the slightest touch
Of your hand and understand I'll be frozen in time
'till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine
If I find you girl, I swear I'll be a good man
I'm not gonna leave it in destiny's hands
I can't sit and wait for my princess to arrive
I gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive
I'll search the whole world for that special girl
When I finally found you, watch our love unfurl

I need love

LL Talking:
Girl, listen to me
When I be sitting in my room all alone
Staring at the wall
Fantasies, they go through my mind and I've come to realize
That I need true love and if you wanna give it to me girl
Make yourself seen I'll be waiting

I love you"

Up in here, it's burnin hot

We on fire

Naw I aint puttin nuttin' out, I smoke when I wanna
26 inch chrome spokes on a Hummer
This heat gon' last for the whole summer
Runnin your bitch faster then the Road Runner
Rocks on my wrist, rolls gold under
Glocks on my hip, those throw thunder
I'm buyin diamond by the pier
But when you stop, the only thing still spinnin is your hair
Yeah, I'm ridin with that all black snub
Raiders cap back, all black gloves
I'm 80s man, but the boy smack thugs
These record sales equal more back rubs
Not to mention I bought a pack of clubs
His impacts about as raw as crack was
Now all these new artists gettin wrong deals
I'm only 21, sittin on mill's

If you know anythin about me, then you know I'm a baller
If I 'ont hit the first night, I aint gon' call her
I'm tryna play, you tryna have my daughter
But I can't blame her for what her momma taught her
And I don't care 'bout what the next nigga bought her
Cause I ain't puttin no baguettes in her butter
I got a diamond about as clear as water
And I got bread, but I ain't spend' quarters
So cut the games ma, lets go in the back
Matter fact, turn your ass round, back a nigga down
And I ain't biast when I'm ridin through the town
Like 'em small, like 'em tall, like 'em black, like 'em brown
She gotta be able to come when I need her
Tight ass pants, little wife beater
Regular chick or R&B diva
Bitch say somethin, I ain't a mind reader

Luda!
She could go lower than i ever really thought she could,
Face down, ass up!
The top of your booty jiggling out your jeans,
Baby pull your pants up,
I like it when i see you do it,
Better then i ever seen it done before,
A lot of women drop it to the ground,
But how low can you go?
Lower then your mama’s ever seen it in her life time,
Never would’ve imagined did not even in her right mind,
Practice in front of that mirror,
Now you doing it on the dance floor,
Mad cause i can’t get wit ya ya just show me how to dance (OH!)
I may not wanna get low so i post it up kinda like a playa do,
But if you come to the crib,
Then i might show you girls a thang or 2,
Yea i think you a superstar wit a ass like that you gotta blow,
Before you make it big,
Theres just 1 thing i gotta know

[Chorus]

How low can you go? [8x]

I could go low, (Go low) lower then you know,
go low,(go low) lower then you know,
go low,(go low)lower then you know,

go low,(go low) lower then you know,

[Luda]

I be like Nick-nac-paddywac,
Oh where my kitty cat give a dog a bone,
How many licks does it takes till i get to the center and let a realer n-gga take you home,
I could make me show stop,
Soon as you hear this flow pop,
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to your drop,
Put the needle on a record and i make her get lower than a Lamborghini,
And if she really gettin low then imma shoot a video and put it all on TV,
Cos i like that French vanilla and the caramel,

But when it comes to chocolate,
I know that very well,
Asian persuasion,
no discrimination,
I love how they seen to please us,
I wanna taste them butterican pican peanut buttercups like reeses pieces,
Cause i think you a superstar,
With a ass like that you gotta blow,
Before you make it big,
Well there just 1 thing i gotta know,

Drop it, hit it, dump it, split it,
Don’t stop, (Get it, get it)
Put it on reverse just to rack it up,

I’ll show you some of this back row,
Yea you a superstar but theres 1 thing i gotta know though,

Got a pocket full of change and they C-note stacks
Bustin dominoes, spades, cee-lo, craps
We shootin pool at the Luda-plex; I slap a hundred on the table
just to see if any fools wanna do it next
I got games galore, I got game for sure
And when I win I spit game to whores (yep)
Or double it back, I'll double the stacks
Throw a dub, a big face or double the stack (boy)
And we can 'bout anything that you wanna do
But come up short and OH THE THANGS that the gun'll do
Throw in the towel cause I'm makin 'em sweat
Or put your house on the line and I can cover the bet
So hurry up and come get some, if you want some
You know the phrase - scared money don't make none!

Throw some money on the books, cause I know how to call 'em
Somebody tell my fam I got a gamblin problem
I don't know when to STOP, maybe when somebody's
drug away by the COPS, or when I'm blowin steam
Countin green in the DROP, because whether legal or illegal
all my people bring the strength to the block
Yessir, I thought you knew it, we loco
We'll bet on anything, just to see if anybody's gon' do it
It's people livin they LIFE comin up off change
And hustlers payin they bills comin up off games
Whether it's Madden or it's Live, tell 'em pick up the sticks
They call me Mr. Put-Down-Two-And-Pick-Up-Six
Then walk away with a clean slate; catch me out in A.C.
Callin yo' bluff with Puff eatin cheesecake
So all my ramblers, runners and money scramblers
Put your drinks up to all compulsive gamblers

Breakin the whole casino and doin backflips, man

Tryin to get me off my grind, but it won't work
Cause I can drink a fifth of gin and it don't hurt

Now who's that bucked-naked cook fixin three-course meals?
Gettin goosebumps when her body tap the six inch heels
What in the world is in that ROOM, what you got in that ROOM?
A couple a gats, a couple of knives
A couple of rats, a couple of wives, now it's time to choose

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
Are you custom-made, custom-paid, or you just custom-fitted?
Playstation 2 up in the ride and is that Lorenzo-kitted?
Is that your wife, your girlfriend or just yo; main bitch?
You take a pick, while I'm rubbin the hips
touchin lips to the top of the dick and then WHOOO!
Now tell me who's your housekeeper and what you keep in yo' house?
What about diamonds and gold, is that what you keep in yo' mouth?
What in the world is in that CASE, what you got in that CASE?
Get up out my face, you couldn't relate, wait to take place
at a similar pace so shake, shake it

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
Get out my business, my biznass
Stay the fuck up out my biznass, ah
Cause these niggaz all up in my shit
and it's my business, my biznass
Stay the fuck up out my biznass

[Verse 1]
Now little Lisa is only 9 years old
Shes tryin' to figure out why the world is so cold
Why shes all all alone and they never met her family
Mamas always gone and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin' and nobody will listenin'
Mama is on drugs gettin' high up in the kitchen
Bringin' home men at different hours of the night
Startin' with laughs--usually endin' in a fight
Sneak into her room while her mamas knocked out
Tryin' to have his way and little Lisa says 'ouch'
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom but her mama don't believe her
Lisa is stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says shes 'bout to run away and never come back.

[Verse 2]
Little Nicole is only 10 years old
She's steady tryin' to figure why the world is so cold
Why shes not pretty and nobody seems to like her
Alcoholic step dad always wanna strike her
Yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises
Teachers ask questions she makin' up excuses
Bleedin' on the inside, cryin' on the out
There's only one girl really knows what she about
Her name is lil' Stacy and they become friends
Promise that they always be tight till the end
Until one day lil' Stacy gets shot
A drive by bullet went stray up on her block
Now Nicole stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but some get her clothes and pack
She says shes 'bout to run away and never come back.

Little Erica is eleven years old
Shes steady tryin' to figure why the world is so cold
So she pops x to get rid of all the pain
Cause shes havin' sex with a boy who's sixteen
Emotions run deep and she thinks shes in love
So theres no protection hes usin' no glove
Never thinkin' bout the consequences of her actions
Livin' for today and not tomorrows satisfaction
The days go by and her belly gets big
The father bails out he ain't ready for a kid
Knowin' her mama will blow it all outta proportion
Plus she lives poor so no money for abortion
Erica is stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but get her clothes and pack
She say shes 'bout to run away and never come back.

And the lights are on and they want a show

[Verse One - Lupe Fiasco]
A fresh cool young Lu
Trying to cash his microphone check two one two
Want to believe my own hype but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees what have you brung you?
Did you improve on the design? Did you do something new?
Well you're name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You, the more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, you come too
And then it hit me standing outside of Heaven waitin' for God to come and get me
I'm too uncouth, unschool'd to the rules and too gum shoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung blue
Go back what ever you did you undo
Heavy as Heaven, the devil on my two tons too

[Chorus - Matthew Santos]
If you are what they say you are - a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones and they wanna know

And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement past the Indian graves where the dinosaurs laid
And out through China nearly misses air liners
Magnified times five this is pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze
Now that's important to say 'cause even with all of that most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid meaning we want it to grow meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called and he told him to wait
Un-strap him from the chair and put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed and they ain't gone clap and they ain't gone praise
They want everything back that they paid 'cause they been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim

[Chorus - Matthew Santos]
If you are that they say you are - a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they want a show

[Verse Three - Lupe Fiasco]
So chauffeur chauffeur come and take me away
'Cause I've been standing in this line for like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along and when I got to the front they told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow and the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every songs a favorite song and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say you need to go and see that
And everybody claps 'cause everybody is pleased
Then they all take the stage and start performing for me

I told you that I'm cold!

Yo I terrorize guys (EXERCISE) street formulas
At hip-hop shows, cause pandemonium
Shit, I ain't concerned until it's my turn
I snatch a mic jump on the stage and show my ass like Howard Stern
But not in that form (hell nah) I perform
lyrical heatwaves, that'll keep your brain warm
But when it's on, you fuck around and get ripped up
or get placed in a bodybag, with that ass zipped up
Toe tag 'em!

GOT HIM!
Even ballistics won't be able to tell, how the fo'-fo' ragged him
Dragged him, halfway down the block
Now you know where a nigga go when a nigga close a nigga shop
(You're as cold as ice) Fuck you!
Tell me something new
On behalf of the First Family staff, and homicide crews
in control - REAL NIGGAZ WON'T FOLD - I told you we were cold

1228,90.0,Madonna,American Pie,"A long, long time ago
I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew that if I had my chance
I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

Did you write the book of love?
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now do you believe in Rock 'n' roll
And can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pick-up truck
But I knew that I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singing

Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry
And good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
When I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

Well now, in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire the most
The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died

We started singing

Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry
And good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry
And good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

We started singing
We started singing
We started singing
We started singing"

Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall

'till then, it will burn inside of me

I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warmth she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside, you can't take that from me

I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned
'till then, it will burn inside of me

The truth is never far behind
You've kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?

If I ran away
I'd never have the strength
To go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart?
Will it grow cold, the secret that I hide?
Will I grow old?
How will they hear?
When will they learn?
How will they know...?

1245,433.0,Mariah Carey,Don't Forget About Us,"'''Verse 1'''
You just let it die
With no goodbyes
Details don't matter
We both paid the price
Tears in my eyes
You know sometimes
It'd be like that baby
Now every time I see you
I pretend I'm fine
When I want to reach out to you
But I turn around
And I let it ride
Baby I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
And don't forget about...

'''Chorus 1'''
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes
You still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

'''Verse 2'''
Oh they say
That you're in a new relationship
But we both know
Nothing comes close to
What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it
How good we used to get it
There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine
No matter what you go through
We are one, that's a fact
That you can't deny
So baby we just can't let
The fire pass us by
Forever we'd both regret
So don't forget about

'''Chorus 2'''
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes
You still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

'''Bridge'''
And if she's got your head all messed up now
That's the trickery
She'll wanna have like you know how this lovin' used to be
I bet she can't do like me
She'll never be MC

1247,1040.0,Mariah Carey,Loverboy,"I got myself a lover
Who knows what I like
When he invites me over
I come every time
And when my sugar daddy
Takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go it’s
Delirium time
He’s all mine
And his lovin’ makes me high
Like a taste of ecstasy
All I need is him to be my loverboy
Loverboy c’mon and love me
Give me more, touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me
All night long
Loverboy c’mon and take me
Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation
All night long
I got myself a lover
And he’s so sublime
It’s quite a bit of heaven
To feel him inside
Cause when my sugar daddy
Takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go
It’s delirium time
I get weak
When his candy kisses sweetly
Caress my whole body
All I need is him to be
My loverboy

When I don't even know who you are
Sayin' we up in your house, sayin' I'm up in your car

But you in LA, and I'm out at Jermaine's
I'm up in the A, you so, so lame
And no one here even mentions your name
It must be the weed, it must be the E
'Cause you be poppin' hood, you get it poppin'

Why you so obsessed with me? Boy, I wanna know
Lyin' that you're sexin' me when everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth still couldn't get this

1251,1859.0,Mariah Carey,We Belong Together,"(Ooh, ooh, sweet love, yeah)

I didn't mean it
When I said I didn't love you, so
I should have held on tight
I never shoulda let you go
I didn't know nothing
I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I could not fathom that I would ever
Be without your love
Never imagined I'd be
Sitting here beside myself
Cause I didn't know you
Cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
Cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give
To have you lying by my side
Right here, cause baby

(We belong together)

[chorus]
When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on
When times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

I can't sleep at night
When you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Saying to me
""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute
This is too deep (too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial
Trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
I only think of you
And it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together
But I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things, crying
Trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
It ain't even half of what
I'm feeling inside
I need you
Need you back in my life, baby

[chorus]
When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on
When times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together, baby

[chorus]
When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on
When times get rough
Who's gonna talk to me
Till the sun comes up
Who's gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh baby, baby

Run away I've got to
Get away

Seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night

Once I ran to you
(I ran)
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Tainted love... oh
Tainted love

Now I know I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
You don't really want any more from me
To make things right
Need someone to hold you tight
And you'll think love is to pray
But I'm sorry I don't pray that way

Once I ran to you
(I ran)
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Tainted love... oh

Don't touch me please
I cannot stand the way you tease
I love you though you hurt me so
Now I'm going to pack my things and go

Touch me baby, tainted love
Touch me baby, tainted love
Touch me baby, tainted love
Touch me baby, tainted love

Once I ran to you

Struggled to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry
Feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath, after that, after that
Try to get you back

I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you

Give me something to believe in
Cause I don't believe in you
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah, so this is goodbye

God damn, my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I left unsaid
I want to dive into you
What you're going through
I get behind, make your move

I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you

Give me something to believe in
Cause I don't believe in you
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference... it even makes a difference to try
Yeah

And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
So this is goodbye

I've been here before
One day I'll wake up
And it won't hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi
The words you say don't have a meaning

Cause I, still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you and I
And so this is goodbye

Give me something to believe in
Cause I don't believe in you
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference... it even makes a difference to try
Yeah

And you told me how you're feeling

The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered ""good-bye"" as she got on a plane
Never to return again but always in my heart

This love has taken its toll on me
She said good-bye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice, cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again, but uh-oh

This love has taken its toll on me
She said good-bye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice, cause I won't say good-bye anymore

I'll fix these broken things, repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's all right
(It's all right, it's all right)
My pressure on your hips, I'm sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me
She said good-bye too many times before
Her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice, cause I won't say good-bye anymore

This love has taken its toll on me
She said good-bye too many times before
My heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice, cause I won't say good-bye anymore

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breaking in front of me

Everybody finds somebody someplace
Theres no tellin' where love may appear
Something in my heart keeps sayin'
my someplace is here.
If I had it in my power, I'd arrange for every girl to have your charm.

Your love made it well worth waiting

In a darkened room
And you're all alone
Looking out the window

Like a broken arrow

Here I stand in the shadows
Come to me, Come to me
Can't you see that

Nobody wants to be lonely
Nobody wants to cry
My body's longing to hold you
so bad it hurts inside
Time is precious and it's slipping away
and I've been waiting for you all of my life
Nobody wants to be lonely so why
Why don't you let me love you

Can you hear my voice
Do you hear my song
It's a serenade
So your heart can find me
And suddenly your flying down the stairs
Into my arms, baby

Before I start going crazy
Run to me, Run to me
Cause I'm dying

Nobody wants to be lonely
Nobody wants to cry
My body's longing to hold you
so bad it hurts inside
Time is precious and it's slipping away
and I've been waiting for you all of my life
Nobody wants to be lonely so why
Why don't you let me love you

I want to feel you deeply
Just like the air you're breathing
I need you here in my life
Don't walk away, don't walk away
don't walk away, don't walk away
No, no, no, no

When purple shadows fall and silver moonlight beams

She loves a carousel, a roller coaster ride
A party or a picnic by the ocean side
And like a laughing brook the dancers in the sun
My lady has a barrel of fun

Life is a gay thing, play thing, hit parade thing
Not a worry not a care
If there's a trombone toottin' a flute a-fluttin'
Sure as shootin' we'll be there

My lady loves to dance, my lady loves to sing
A schottische or a polka or a gaylin' fling
And when we kiss goodnight the moment we're apart

I ain’t gon’ let nothing get in my way
No matter what nobody has to say

Feels so good, when you’re doing all the things that you want to do
Get the best out of life, treat yourself to something new
It’s a really good thing to say
That I won’t change my life, my life’s just fine

Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh
Just fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh
See I won’t change my life, my life’s just fine

So I like what I see when I’m looking at me
When I’m walking past the mirror
Don't stress through the night, at a time in my life
Ain’t worried about if you feel it
Got my head on straight, I got my vibe right
I ain’t gonna let you kill it
You see I wouldn’t change my life, my life’s just…..

Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh
Just fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooooh
You see I wouldn’t change my life, my life’s just fine"

When my insides are wracked with anxiety.
You have the touch that will quiet me.
You lift my spirit. You melt the ice.

Never be the same again.

You're always there. You are my shoulder to cry on.
I can't believe it took me quite so long.
To take the forbidden step.
Is this something that I might regret?

Nothing ventured nothing gained.
(You are the one)
A lonely heart that can't be tamed.
(Come on, come on)
I'm hoping that you feel the same.

It's just the beginning it's not the end.
Things will never be the same again.
It's not a secret anymore.
Now we've opened up the door.
Starting tonight and from now on.
We'll never, never be the same again.
Never be the same again.


Now I know that we were close before.
I'm glad I realised I need you so much more.

The US to UK, NYC to LA.
From sidewalks to highways.
See it'll never be the same again.
What I'm sayin'
My mind frame never changed 'til you came rearranged.

But sometimes it seems completely forbidden.
To discover those feelings that we kept so well hidden.
Where there's no competition.
And you render my condition.
Though improbable it's not impossible.
For a love that could be unstoppable.

But wait.
A fine line's between fate and destiny.
Do you believe in the things that were just meant to be?
When you tell me the stories of your quest for me.
Picturesque is the picture you paint effortlessly.

And as our energies mix and begin to multiply.
Everyday situations, they start to simplify.
So things will never be the same between you and I.
We intertwined our life forces and now we're unified.


I thought that we would just be friends.
Things will never be the same again.
It's just the beginning it's not the end.
Things will never be the same again.
It's not a secret anymore.

Starting tonight and from now on.
We'll never, never be the same again.

Never be the same again.
It's not a secret anymore.
We'll never be the same again.
It's not a secret anymore.

I can take you away from here
So lonely inside
So busy out there
And all you wanted
Was somebody who cares

I'm sinking slowly
So hurry hold me
Your hand is all I have to keep me hanging on
Please can you tell me
So I can finally see
Where you go when you're gone

I can save you
I can take you away from here
So lonely inside
So busy out there
And all you wanted
Was somebody who cares

All you wanted was somebody who cares
If you need me you know I'll be there
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah

Do I attract you?
Do I repulse you with my queasy smile?
Am I too dirty?
Am I too flirty?
Do I like what you like?

I could be wholesome
I could be loathsome
I guess I'm a little bit shy
Why don't you like me?
Why don't you like me without making me try?

I try to be like Grace Kelly
But all her looks were too sad
So I try a little Freddie
I've gone identity mad

I could be brown
I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful
I could be purple
I could be anything you like
Gotta be green
Gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Why don't you like me?
Why don't you like me?
Why don't you walk out the door?

How can I help it?
How can I help it?
How can I help what you think?
Hello my baby
Hello my baby
Putting my life on my brink

Why don't you like me?
Why don't you like me?
Why don't you like yourself?
Should I bend over?
Should I look older just to be put on your shelf?

I try to be like Grace Kelly
But all her looks were too sad
So I try a little Freddie
I've gone identity mad

I could be hurtful

I could be anything you like

Why don't you like me?
Why don't you like me?
Walk out the door

Say what you want to satisfy yourself
But you only want what everybody else says you should want
You want

I could be brown
I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful
I could be purple
I could be anything you like
Gotta be green

Wrapped around the finger of some fair-weather friend
Caught up in the promises, left out in the end
No pride, taken for a ride

I want to believe you but you know how to lie

And if you say you understand I don't believe it

And if you say you take the blame I don't believe it
And if say that nothing's changed I don't believe it, don't believe it

There's one born every minute and you're looking at him

And when you swear that you are mine I don't believe it

1325,1285.0,Miley Cyrus,Party In the U.S.A.,"I hopped off the plane at LAX with a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame, excess, whoa am I gotta fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign

This is all so crazy, everybody seems so famous
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio

And the Jay-Z song was on
And the Jay-Z song was on
And the Jay-Z song was on

So I put my hands up, they're playin' my song
The butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like ""Yeah!""
Movin' my hips like ""Yeah!""

Got my hands up, they're playin' my song
And now I'm gonna be okay
Yeah! It's a party in the USA!
Yeah! It's a party in the USA!

Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's lookin' at me now
Like ""Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks
She's gotta be from out of town""

So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune

And the Britney song was on
And the Britney song was on
And the Britney song was on

So I put my hands up, they're playin' my song
The butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like ""Yeah!""
Movin' my hips like ""Yeah!""

Got my hands up, they're playin' my song
And now I'm gonna be okay
Yeah! It's a party in the USA!
Yeah! It's a party in the USA!

Feel like hoppin' on a flight, on a flight
Back to my hometown tonight, town tonight
Something stops me every time, every time
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright

So I put my hands up, they're playin' my song
The butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like ""Yeah!""
Movin' my hips like ""Yeah!""

Got my hands up, they're playin' my song

When something is right,
I feel like I must have known you,
In another life,
Cause I felt this deep connection,
When you looked in my eyes,

I just kept looking down,
I st-st-stuttered when
You asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me

I will redeem myself,

Deep inside
When you called and asked to see me
Tomorrow night,
I'm not a mind reader,
But I'm reading the signs
That you can't wait to see me again

This is why I’m hot(x2)
This is why(x2) uh
This is why I’m hot (uh)
This is why I’m hot(x2)
This is why(x2)
This is why I’m hot

I’m hot cuz I’m fly (fly)
You ain’t cuz you not
This is why x2
This is why I’m hot(x2)

Verse 1:

This is why I’m hot
I don't gotta rap
I can sell a mil sayin nothin on the track
I represent New York
I got it on my back
In this state that we lost
So I’mma bring it back
I love the dirty dirty
Cuz homies show me love
The ladies start to bounce
As soon as I hit the club
But in the Midwest
They love to take it slow
So when I hit the club
I watch them get it on the floor
And if you need it hyphy
I take it to the bay
Frisco to Sac town
They do it any day
Coppin a Hollywood
As soon as I hit LA
I’m in that low low
I do it the cali way
And when I hit the Chi
People say that I’m fly
They love the way I dress they like
They like my my attire
They love how I move crowds from side to side
They ask me how I do it and simply I reply

(Chorus)

Verse 2:
This is why I’m hot
Catch me on the block
Every other day
Another person another drop
16 bars, 24 pop, 44 songs
Gimme what you got
I’m in there driving cars
Push them off the lot
I’m into shutting stores down so I can shop
If you need a bird I can get it chopped
Tell me what you need you know I get ‘em by the flock
I call my hommie black meet me on the ave
I hit wash heights with the money in the bag
we into big spinners
See my pimping never dragged
Find me with different women that you people never had
For those who say they know me know I’m focused on my cream
Playa you come between you’d better focus on the beam
I keep it so clean the way you see me lean
And when I say I’m hot my homie this is what I mean

(Chorus)

Verse 3:
This is why I’m hot
Shorty see the drop
Ask me what I paid and I say yeah I paid a guap
And then I hit the switch that take away the top
So chicks around the way they call me cream of the crop
They hop in the car
I tell them all about
We hit the studio they say they like the way I record
I gave you black train and I did you wrong
So everytime I see them and they tell me that’s their song
They say I’m the bomb
They love the way the charm hanging from the neck
And compliments the arm which compliments the ear then comes the gear
So when I hit the room the shorties stop and stare
Then homies start to hate rearrange their face
Little do they know I keep them things by waist side
I reply nobody gotta die
Similar to lil weez cuz I got the fire

You'll never be what is in your heart
Weep Little Lion Man,
You're not as brave as you were at the start
Rate yourself and rake yourself,
Take all the courage you have left
Wasted on fixing all the problems 
That you made in your own head

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear?
Didn't I, my...

Tremble for yourself, my man,
You know that you have seen this all before
Tremble Little Lion Man,
You'll never settle any of your scores
Your grace is wasted in your face,
Your boldness stands alone among the wreck
Now learn from your mother or else spend your days Biting your own neck

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line
I really fucked it up this time
Didn't I, my dear? (x2)

They're gonna clean up your looks
With all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you

Because they sleep with a gun
And keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do

Because the drugs never work
They gonna give you a smirk
'Cause they got methods of keeping you clean

They gonna rip off your heads
Your aspirations to shreds
Another cog in the murder machine

They said all
Teenagers scare
The living shit out of me
They could care less
As long as someone'll bleed
So darken your clothes
Or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone
But not me

The boys and girls in the click
The awful names that the stick
You're never gonna fit in much, kid
But if you're troubled and hurt
What you got under your shirt
Will make them pay for the things that they did

1356,1874.0,My Chemical Romance,Welcome to the Black Parade,"When I was
A young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band

He said
Son when you grow up
Would you be
The savior of the broken
The beaten, and the damn

He said
Will you defeat them
Your demons
And all the non-believers
The plans that they have made

Because one day
I'll leave you
A phantom
To lead you in the summer,
To join The Black Parade

When I was
A young boy
My father
Took me into the city
To see a marching band

He said
Son when you grow up
Would you be
The savior of the broken
The beaten and the damn

Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
Went through it all
The rise and fall
The bodies in the streets
And when you're gone we want you all to know

We'll carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And in my heart I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it

A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back
And let's shout out loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call

To carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

On and on we carry through the fears
Over the disappointed faces of your peers
Oh, oh, oh
Take a look at me
'Cause I could not care at all

Do or die
You'll never make me
Because the world
Will never take my heart
Go and try
You'll never break me
You want it all
You want to play this part
I won't explain
Or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed
I'm gonna show my scar
Give a cheer
Listen here
Because it's who we are
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy, who had to sing this song
I'm just a man
I'm not a hero
I don't care!

We'll carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated,
Your weary widow marches on

''Do or die
You'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try
You'll never break me
You want it all''
We'll carry on
''You want to play this part
Do or die''

Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

Yeah
Oh, oh

I break tradition
Sometimes my tries are outside the lines
We've been conditioned to not make mistakes
But I can't live that way, oh

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words
That you could not find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else

Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open

perch� lo sapevamo gi� (Sha-la-la)
che lo zio ci avrebbe procurato delle donne
con estrema facilit� (Sha-la-la)
tutti in macchina la festa � lontana e poi
c'� mio zio che ci aspetta l� (Sha-la-la)
oh! ragazzi tranqui questa � una botta sicura,
basta solo che paghiamo

Rotta per casa di zio
stiamo volando alla festa
Rotta per casa di zio
e siam gi� l� con la testa
e le troveremo l� sul divano e poi
con le gambe aperte, vibratori in mano e noi
le ingropperemo e le daremo le botte
ci divertiremo per tutta la notte.

Arriviamo dallo zio che dice: ?Ah!
bene, siete arrivati? (Sha-la-la)
?Zio, dicci subito dove son le donne
che siamo tutti arrapati? (Sha-la-la)
Ma appena entrati chiude la porte e poi
vediamo attorno a noi (Sha-la-la)
sei giganti che ci fissano in silenzio di tomba
e di donne manco l'ombra!

?Scusa un attimo zio,
ma che cos'� questa festa ?
Scusa un attimo zio,
ma sei uscito di testa??

C?hanno preso e legato al divano e poi
con le gambe aperte e vibratori in mano e poi
c?hanno ingroppato e ci han dato le botte
si son divertiti per tutta la notte

Con le facce tutte tese e pieni di malanni
e le pive nel sacco (Sha-la-la)
presi con l?inganno da zio e compagni
stanotte il culo c?han fatto (Ahi-ahi-ahi)
E chi l'avrebbe detta che sarebbe finita cos�,
che figura del cazzo noi! (Sha-la-la)
Io, che mio zio fosse gay, mica lo sapevo?
volevo darlo ma l?ho preso!

Rotto in culo mio zio,
che c?ha fatto la festa!
Rotto in culo mio zio
per� che notte diversa!

Tutti col bavaglio in bocca e legati e poi
con le braghe ed i mutandoni calati noi:
cinque deficienti al culo per aria:
siam rimasti cos� per un pacco di tempo!

Rotto in culo mio zio,
che c?ha fatto la festa!"

You know I'm only testing you out.
Hey man, don't look so angry,
you're real close to figuring me out.

We are a part of a circle.
It's like a mobius strip,
and it goes round and round until it loses a link.
And there's a shadow in the sky and it looks like rain,
and shit is gonna fly once again.

Hey, man, we look at each other with ample eyes,
so why not some time to discover what's behind your eyes?
I've got so many questions that I want to ask you.
I am so tired of mirrors- pour me a glass of your wine!

And there's a shadow in the sky and it looks like rain,
and shit is gonna fly once again!
I've got a bunch of government cheques at my door.
Each morning I try to send them back but they only send me more.
I look at myself in the mirror; am I vital today?
Hey, man, I let my conscience get in the way!

And there's a shadow in the sky , and it looks like rain,
and shit is gonna fly once again,
and I don't mean to rain on your parade,
but pathos has got me once again...
and I don't want ambivalence no more,
I don't want ambivalence no more,
I don't want ambivalence no more,
no I don't want ambivalence no more!"

Flirtatious, tryin' to show patience
Lookin' for the right time to shoot my steelo
Lookin' for the right time to flash them keys
Then um I'm leavin, please believe in
Me and the rest of my heathens
Checkin out a lot at the top of the Four Seasons
Penthouse, roof top, birds I'm feedin'
No deceivin', nothin' up my sleeve, no teasin'
I need you to get up up on the dance floor
Give that man what he askin' for
'Cos I feel like bustin' loose and I feel like touchin' you
And can't nobody stop the juice, so baby tell me what's the use
I said

(Chorus)
It's getting hot in here
So take off all your clothes
I am gettin so hot, I wanna take my clothes off

Why you at the bar if you ain't poppin' the bottles
What good is all the fame if you ain't fuckin' the models
I see you drivin' sportscars, ain't hittin' the throttle
And I be damned I do a hundred, top down in goggles
Get off the freeway, exit 106 and parked it
Ash tray, flip gate, time to spark it
Gucci collar for dollar, got out and walked it
I spit game 'cos baby I can't talk it
Walls, sweatin', it's hot up in this joint
Vokal tanktop on at this point
Your with a winner so baby you can't lose
I got secrets, can't leave Cancun
So take it off like your home alone
You know, dancin in front your mirror while you're on the phone
Checkin' your reflection and tellin' your best friend
'Like girl, I think my butt gettin' big'

Mix a little bit a ah, ah
With a little bit a ah, ah
(Let it just fall out)
Give a little bit a ah, ah
With a little bit a ah, ah
(Let it hang all out)
With a little bit a ah, ah
And a sprinkle of that ah, ah
(Let it just fall out)
I like it when ya ah, ah
Girl, baby make it ah, ah

Stop pacin', time wastin'
I got a friend with a pole in the basement (what)
I'm just kiddin' like Jason (oh)
Unless you gon' do it
Extra, extra spread the news
Nelly took a trip from the Lunar to Neptune
Came back with somethin' thicker than fittin' in sasoons
Say she like to think about cuttin' in restrooms

I never thought I would be needed for anything
I can't believe my shoulders would carry such important weight
As your head and your tears
I can't believe you chose me, in all my fragility, me
It hurts so much when i love you, it makes me cry
Every time

You, you are, oh you are
The little boy made for me in the stars
In the stars, that's why I can't let you go
The little boy made for me in the stars
That's why I love you more the further I go
And before this existence you were always there
Waiting for me
You are, you are the realest thing I know
Hands down
The realest thing I know

I am not used to being carried
Or being able to carry a pretty song
I have been bruised by my many trails
Sometimes my skin's so thick it's frail
I just need to be ignored 'til I wake up to the beauty that is yours
And it all comes to life so, so suddenly
This is a place so deep, the water's so deep I hesitate, cause
All the energy it takes to feel this power
I tend to run, I tend to hide, 'til I find you and I know I got you
I know, I know, I know

You're the little boy made for me in the stars
In the stars, that's why I can't let you go
The little boy made for me in the stars
That's why I love you more the further I go
And before this existence you were always here
Inside of me
You are, you are the realest thing I know
Hands down...the realest thing I know

I'm sliding on the rainbows of my childhood dreams
I'm sliding on the rainbows of my childhood dreams

When you carry me, when you carry me, when you carry me
It's so happy

I'm sliding on the rainbows of my childhood dreams
I'm sliding on the rainbows of my childhood dreams"

I used to pride myself on being the other man
But now it's flipped and I don't want you with no other man
Why can't you understand anything I'm offering
I gave you the world but you just wanted arguing
From the time I picked you up, until the time I dropped you off again
Even flipped out on me at the mall again
""it's all his fault again"" that's what you telling all ya friends

I ain't pointing fingers ma, I just wanna call again
See how ya day going I know they stressin on ya
I know them times get hard that's why I'm checkin on ya
It's yours truly ma, I got a little message for ya
Anything he can do, girl I can do it better for ya, cause

Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gonna still be as one it's forever, it's forever

Won't you come on and go with me
Come on over to my place
Won't you sit ya self down and take a seat
And let me ease ya mind girl
We gon do it our way

I heard your friend told a friend that told a friend of mine
That you was thinking that we should do it one more time
If this aint the truth then hopefully it's not a lie
Cause I aint got no issue's with hitting at another time
We never had a problem gettin it done
Disagreed upon a lot ma but the sex wasn't one
Now check it I know u get excited (still) when I come round and
bite it (girl)
Quit frowin up and quit actin like you don't like

I like it, I like it, I really, really like it, I want it, adore

Won't you sit ya self down and take a seat
And let me ease ya mind girl
We gon do it our way

Shawty where you been
Feels like a long time, long, long time since I seen ya
Yes it has girl, when I know I said some fucked up things to u
before
But girl u know I didn't mean it
(I didn't mean one single word)
(I never meant one single word)
If I could take back every word I would and more fo sho
If I thought that you believe it
Cause you make my life so convenient for me

When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gonna still be as one it's forever, it's forever

You lookin' for her in the day time with the light.

Timbaland: You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night.

Nelly: You expect me to just let you hit it.
Will you still respect me if you get it?

Timbaland: All I can do is try, give me one chance.
What's the problem? I don't see no ring on your hand
I be the first to admit it.
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent.

To see if you can work me the way you say.

In endless circles,
Running from my self until,
You gave me a reason for standing still

Barely breathing,
Give me something,
To believe in
Tell me: It's not all in my head

Take what's left
Of this man
Make me whole

To find the one in this life
The one we all dream of
But dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing
I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting
Will play out like a scene straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holdin' my breath
Right up to the end
Until that moment when
I find the one that I'll spend forever with

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
Somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight
And, damn, it this feels too right
It's just like dejaÂ vu
Me standin' here with you
So I'll be holdin`my breath
Could this be the end
Is it that moment when
I find the one that I spend forever with

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
Is there somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

You can't give up
When you're looking for a diamond in the rough
Because you never know when it shows up
Make sure you're holding on
'Cause it could be the one, the one you're waiting on

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There has gotta be somebody for me

Nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
Is there somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Every time I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey’s head?

And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneakin’ out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must’ve done it half a dozen times

I wonder if it’s too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life’s better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn’t let me in
Oh oh oh
Oh god I, I

I had the photo album spread out on the bedroom floor

Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Goodbye

Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down

We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we’d know
We said someday we’d find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She’s had a couple of kids since then
I haven’t seen her since God knows when
Oh oh oh
Oh god I, I

I had the photo album spread out on the bedroom floor

It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it

If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on the bedroom floor
It’s hard to say it
Time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for

And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough for ten plus me

I'll need a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it

1422,677.0,No Doubt,Hey Baby (feat. Bounty Killer),"I’m the kind of girl that hangs with the guys
Like a fly on the wall with my secret eyes
Taking it in, try to be feminine
With my makeup bag watching all the sin

Misfit, I sit, lit up, wicked
Everybody else surrounded by the girls
With the tank tops and the flirty words

I’m just sipping on chamomile
Watching boys and girls and their sex appeal
With a stranger in my face who says he knows my mom
And went to my high school

All the boys say
""Hey baby, hey baby, hey""
Girls say, girls say
""Hey baby, hey baby, hey""
""Hey baby, hey baby, hey""
Boys say, boys say
""Hey baby, hey baby, hey""
All the boys get the girls in the back

I’m the one they feed upon
Give a bit a star is born
If you're hot enough you’ll get the pass
So you can tell your friends
How you made it back

No matter what they say I’m still the same
Somehow everybody knows my name
And all the girls wanna get with the boys
And the boys really like it

All the boys say
""Hey baby, hey baby, hey""
Girls say, girls say
""Hey baby, hey baby, hey""
""Hey baby, hey baby, hey""
Boys say, boys say
""Hey baby, hey baby, hey""

Got me off the hook and nuttin’ else
Don´t
Phase me
Can you be my one and only sunshine
Baby
If no, maybe, hey baby

Not only in love, I was obsessed
With a friendship that no one else could touch
It didn’t work out, I’m covered in shells

And all I wanted was the simple things
A simple kind of life
And all I needed was a simple man
So I could be a wife

I’m so ashamed, I’ve been so mean
I don’t know how it got to this point
I always was the one with all the love
You came along, I’m hunting you down

Like a sick domestic abuser looking for a fight
And all I wanted was the simple things
A simple kind of life

If we met tomorrow for the very first time
Would it start all over again?
Would I try to make you mine?

I always thought I’d be a mom
Sometimes I wish for a mistake
The longer that I wait the more selfish that I get
You seem like you’d be a good dad

Now all those simple things are simply too complicated for my life
How’d I get so faithful to my freedom?
A selfish kind of life
When all I ever wanted was the simple things

Someone more like me
There's times when this dress rehearsal
Seems incomplete
But you see the colors in me like no one else
And behind your dark glasses you're
You're somethin' else

You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely

You know some real bad tricks
And you need some discipline
But lately you've been tryin' real hard
And givin' me your best
And you give me the most gorgeous sleep
That I've ever had
And when it's really bad
I guess it's not that bad

You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely

So many moons that we have seen
Stumblin' back next to me
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better
Better, better

For real
'Cause underneath it all,
You are my real Prince Charmin'
Like the heat from the fire
You were always burnin'
Anytime you're around
My body keeps callin'
For your touch
Your kisses and your sweet romancin'
There's another side to you
And it's a human I adore
Aside from your temper
Everything else secure
Oh no, you're good for me baby
Of that, I'm a sure
'Cause over and over again
Me want more

You've used up all your coupons
And all you've got left is me
And somehow I'm full of forgiveness
I guess it's meant to be

You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely

You're really lovely

You want to love me

Taste every potion cos if yer like yerself a lot
Go let it out, go let it in, go let it out

Life is precocious in a most perculiar way
Sister psychosis don't got a lot to say
She go let it out, she go let it in, she go let it out
She go let it out, she go let it in, she go let it out

Is it any wonder why Princes & Kings
Are clowns that caper in their sawdust rings
And ordinary people that are like you and me
We're the keepers of their destiny

I'm gonna leaving this city, I'm gonna drivin' outta town
And your comin' with me the right time is always now
To go let it out, and go let it in, and go let it out
To go let it out, to go let it in,and go let it out

Is it any wonder why Princes and Kings
Are clowns that caper in their sawdust rings
Cos ordinary people that are like you and me
We're the builders of their destiny
We're the builders of their destiny
We're the builders of their destiny
We're the builders of their destiny

Go let it out - don't let it in

Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself it's someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

And don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm

We ain't too pretty we ain't too proud
We might be laughing a bit too loud

The stained-glass curtain you're hiding behind
Never lets in the sun

You got a brand new soul and a cross of gold

Some say it's better but I say it ain't

By the cruel force of nature from the blue
Instead of a night full of romance supreme
All I got was a runny nose and Agiatic flu

It's raining on prom night, my hair is a mess
It's running all over my taffeta dress
It's wilting the quilting on my maiden form
And mascara flows right down my nose because of the storm

I don't even have a corsage, oh gee
It fell down a sewer with my sister's ID

(talking)
Yes, it's raining on prom night.
Oh my darling, what can I do? I miss you.
It's raining real rain from the skies
and it's draining real menstrual blood from my thighs
over you, all over you. Oh dear god,
make him feel the same way I do right now.
He'll never want to eat me again.

What can I do? It's raining, raining from the skies
It's raining tears from my eyes over you
Oooooow, raining from the skies over you

To the studio tryin' to fight me

That's my house, I disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private schools, daycare, shit, medical bills, I pay that
I love your mom and everything, see I ain't no one to lay down
She wanna rip you up start a custody war, my lawyer stay down
She never had a chance to hear my side of the story, we was divided
She had fish fries, cookouts, on my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

Got a special thing going on
You say it's puppy love
We say it's full grown
Hope that we feel this
Feel this way forever

But you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson
Ten times out of nine, and if I'm lyin' find
The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love theme, together dream
Bout that crib with the goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever
Forever never seems that long until your grown
And notice that the day by day rule can't be too long
Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Askin' what happened to the feelin' that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads
It happened for a reason one can't be, mad
So know this, know that everything is cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school, and graduation

See you and your lil' nosey ass homegirls got ya ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left the straddlin', ride this thing on out
And you and your girl ain't speakin' no more cuz my dick all in her mouth

So who you placing the blame on, you keep on singing that same song
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on

'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they try to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head,
A sock hop beneath my bed,
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread (thread, thread)

I wish I would have known
Cause I didn't kiss my mama good-bye
I didn't tell her how that I loved her
how much I care
Didn't thank my pop for all the talks and all the wisdom he shared
unaware I just did what I always do
Everyday the same routine before I skate off to school
But who knew this day wasn't like the rest
Instead of taking the test I took two to the chest
Call me blind but I didn't see it coming
Everybody was running but i couldn't hear nothing
Except gun blast
It happened so fast
I didn't really know this kid though I sit by him in class
Maybe this kid was reaching out for love
Or maybe for a moment he forgot who he was
Or maybe this kid just wanted to be hugged
Whatever it was I know its because

We are we are, the youth of the nation
We are we are, youth of the nation
We are we are, the youth of the nation
We are we are, youth of the nation

Little Susie she was only twelve
She was given the world with every chance to excel
Hang with the boys and hear the stories they tell
She might act kind of proud with no respect for herself
She was loved in all the wrong places
The same situations just different faces
Changed up her pace since her daddy left her
Too bad he never told she deserved much better

Johnny boy always played the fool
He broke all the rules so you would think he was cool
But he was never really one of the guys no matter how hard he tried
Often thought of suicide
Its kind of hard when you ain't got no friends
He put his life to an end they might remember him then
You cross the line and theres no turning back
Told the world how he felt with the sound of a gat

We are we are, the youth of the nation
We are we are, youth of the nation
We are we are, the youth of the nation
We are we are, youth of the nation

[SOLO]

Whos to blame for the life that tragedies claim
No matter what you say it don't take away the pain that I feel inside
Im tired of all the lies
Don't nobody know why
just the blind leading the blind

(Well) I guess thats the way the story goes
Well it never makes sense
Somebody's gotta know

Theres gotta be more to life then this
Theres gotta be more to everything I thought exists

We are we are, the youth of the nation
We are we are, youth of the nation

We are we are (we are we are), the youth of the nation
We are we are (we are we are), youth of the nation
We are we are, (we are we are) the youth of the nation
We are we are, (we are we are) youth of the nation
We are we are, (we are we are) the youth of the nation
We are we are, (we are we are)youth of the nation (youth of the nation)
We are, youth of the nation (x3)

And I just wanna be alone
I'm pissed cause you came around
Why don't you just go home?
Cause you channeled all your pain
And I can't help you fix yourself
You're making me insane
All I can say is

I tear my heart open
I sew myself shut
My weakness is that I care too much
And the scars remind us
That the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

I tried to help you once
Against my own advice
I saw you going down
But you never realized
That you're drowning in the water
So I offered you my hand
Compassion's in my nature
Tonight is our last stand

I tear my heart open
I sew myself shut
My weakness is that I care too much
And the scars remind us
That the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

I'm drank and I'm feeling down
And I just wanna be alone
You should have never come around
Why don't you just go home?
Cause you're drowning in the water
And I tried to grab your hand
I left my heart open
But you didn't understand

GO FIX YOURSELF!

I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry but I've gotta move on with my own life

She's got a body like an hourglass that's ticking like a clock.
It's a matter of time before we all run out--
When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth.

I waited eight long months, she finally set him free,
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me.
Two weeks, and we had caught on fire,
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile.

Whoa, I never meant to brag,
But I got him where I want him now.
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag,
To steal it all away from you now.

But, God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now.
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause, God, it just feels so--
It just feels so good.

Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change,
Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry that'll never change.
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged,
I'm sorry, honey, but I'm passing up, now look this way.

Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you,
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who.
They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right,
Well, I refuse, I refuse, I refuse!

Whoa, I never meant to brag,
But I got him where I want him now.
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag,
To steal it all away from you now.

But, God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him right now.
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause, God, it just feels so…
It just feels so good.

I watched his wildest dreams come true,
Not one of them involving you.
Just watch my wildest dreams come true,
Not one of them involving…

But they've got planes and trains and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends will all make fun of us
and we'll just laugh along because we know
That none of them have felt this way
Delilah I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And you're to blame

Hey there Delilah
You be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school
And I'll be making history like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there Delilah here's to you
This one's for you

Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
What you do to me"

And let me know just how you feel

I'd be the one who would slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie

She fuckin' hates me
Trust
She fuckin' hates me
La, la, la love
I tried too hard
And she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away

She was queen for about an hour
After that, shit got sour
She took all I ever had
No sign of guilt
No feeling pain, no

What hurts the most

And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do

It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I'm doin' it
It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone
Still harder
Getting up, getting dressed, livin' with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

One early morning, as I was walking
I met a woman, we started talking
I took her home, to get a few nips
But all I had was a mint julep

I don’t remember just how I started
I only know that we should have parted
I stole a kiss, and then another
I didn’t mean to take it further
One mint julep was the cause of it all

The lights were burning low, there in the parlor
When through the kitchen door, up popped her father
He said “I saw you when you kissed my daughter
Better wed her right now, or face a slaughter!�?
I didn’t know just what I was doing
I had to marry or face ruin

A mint julep, a mint julep
A mint julep, a mint julep
One mint julep was the cause of it all

Now, I don’t want to bore you with my troubles
But from now on I’ll be thinking double
I’m through with flirting and drinking whiskey
I got six extra children from a-getting frisky

A mint julep, a mint julep
A mint julep, a mint julep
One mint julep was the cause of it all"

Then I come home again

I light a cigarette
'Cause I can't get no sleep
Theres nothing on the TV nothing on the radio
That means that much to me

All my life
Watching America
All my life
There's panic in America
Oh Oh Oh, Oh
There's trouble in America
Oh Oh Oh, Oh

Yesterday was easy
Happiness came and went
I got the movie script
But I don't know what it meant

I light a cigarette
'Cause I can't get no sleep
Theres nothing on the TV nothing on the radio
That means that much to me
Theres nothing on the TV nothing on the radio
That I can believe in

All my life
Watching America
All my life
There's panic in America
Oh Oh Oh, Oh
There's trouble in America
Oh Oh Oh, Oh
There's panic in America
Oh Oh Oh, Oh

Yesterday was easy
Yes I got the news
When you get it straight, but stand up you just can't lose
Give you my confidence, all my faith in life

Dont stand me up
Don't let me down
I need you tonight
To hold me, say you'll be here
To hold me, say you'll be here
To hold me, say you'll be here
To hold..

All my life
Watching America
All my life
There's panic in America
Oh Oh Oh, Oh
She's just in America
Oh Oh Oh, Oh

Tell me how does it feel
Tell me how does it feel
Tell me how does it feel
Tell me how does it feel"
1551,841.0,Razorlight,In the Morning,"I don't know what I'm doing wrong
Maybe I've been here too long
The songs on the radio sound the same
Everybody just looks the same
But then last night was so much fun
And now your sheets are dirty
The streets are dirty too but
You never look back over what you've done
Remember when you were young
You'd lose yourself
In the morning, you know you won't remember a thing
In the morning, you know it's gonna be alright

Wake him up, warm him up
Put him on the stage, well
The boy can't help it, it's not his fault
Just a dangerous dangerous thing
But then every night's still so much fun
And you're still out there darling
Clinging on to the wrong ideas but
I never regret anything I've done

Remember when you were young
You'd lose yourself
In the morning you know he won't remember a thing
In the morning you know it's gonna be alright

In the morning, you know he won't remember a thing

1553,281.0,Red Hot Chili Peppers,Can't Stop,"Can't stop addicted to the shin dig
Chop top he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
Defunct the pistol that you pay for
This punk the feeling that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
Eastside love is living on the westend
Knock out but boy you better come to
Don't die you know the truth is some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burnin' so bright I wonder what the wave meant
White heat is screaming in the jungle
Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers
Come back strong with 50 belly dancers

The world I love
The tears I drop
To be part of
The wave can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you
The world I love
The trains I hop
To be part of
The wave can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Sweetheart is bleeding in the snowcone
So smart she's leading me to ozone
Music the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature
I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight the gold of meditation
This chapter's going to be a close one
Smoke rings I know you're going to blow one
All on a spaceship persevering
Use my hands for everything but steering
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
Mop tops are happy when they feed you
J. Butterfly is in the treetop
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

The world I love
The tears I drop
To be part of
The wave can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you
The world I love
The trains I hop
To be part of
The wave can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Wait a minute I'm passing out
Win or lose just like you
Far more shocking
Than anything I ever knew
How about you
Ten more reasons
Why I need somebody new just like you
Far more shocking than anything I ever knew
Right on cue

Can't stop addicted to the shin dig
Chop top he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
Defunkt the pistol that you pay for
This punk the feeling that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
Eastside love is living on the westend
Knock out but boy you better come to
Don't die you know the truth is some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burnin' so bright I wonder what the wave meant

Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering
Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get two maybe even three of these
Coming from space
To teach you of the Pleiades
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read through"
1554,382.0,Red Hot Chili Peppers,Dani California,"Getting born in the state of Mississippi
Papa was a copper
And Mama was a hippie

In Alabama she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama

She never knew that there was
Anything more than poor
What in the world does your
Company take me for

Black bandanna, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin', ""Baby watcha gonna""

Looking down the barrel of a hot metal .45
Just another way to survive

California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess; I'm your priest

She's a lover, baby and a fighter
Shoulda seen it comin' when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
The day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya

A little loaded she was stealin' another breath
I love my baby to death

California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess; I'm your priest

Who knew the other side of you?
Who knew what others died to prove?
Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true to say say say

Push the fader, gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota

Down in the Badlands, she was savin' the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast

California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess; I'm your priest

I don't believe it's fair
Slittin' my throat
It's all I ever

I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up and brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I've got to take it on the otherside

Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I married the sea
Stranger things could never change my mind
I've got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

How long how long will I slide
Separate my side

Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts
She wants to know am I still a slut
I've got to take it on the otherside

A scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
A candidate for a soul mate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread
I've got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

How long how long will I slide
Separate my side
I don't
I don't believe it's fair

Turn me on, take me for a hard ride
Burn me out leave me on the otherside
I yell and tell it that
It's not my friend
I tear it down I tear it down
But then it's born again

How long how long will I slide

The things that I tried
Were in my life
Just to get high on

When I sit alone
Come get a little known
But I need more
Than myself this time

Step from the road
To the sea to the sky
And I do believe
That we rely on

When I lay it on
Come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

Hey oh
Listen what I say oh
I got your hey oh
Now listen what I say oh

When will I know
That I really can't go
To the well once more
Time to decide on

When it's killing me
When will I really see
All that I need to look inside

Come to believe
That I better not leave
Before I get my chance to ride

When it's killing me
What do I really need
All that I need to look inside

Hey oh
Listen what I say oh
Come back and hey oh
Look at what I say oh

The more I see, the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey oh, woah

Deep beneath the cover
Of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow

Privately divided
By a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go

In between the cover
Of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow

Running through the field
Where all my tracks
Will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

When to descend
To amend for a friend
All the channels
That have broken down

Now you bring it up
I'm gonna ring it up
Just to hear you sing it out

Step from the road
To the sea to the sky
And I do believe
What we rely on

When I lay it on
Come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

Hey oh
Listen what I say oh
I got your hey oh
Listen what I say oh

The more I see the less I know
The more I like to let it go

Privately divided
By a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go

In between the cover
Of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow

Running through the field
Where all my tracks
Will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

I said hey, hey, yeah
Oh yeah, tell my love now
Hey, hey, yeah
Oh yeah, tell my love now

Deep beneath the cover
Of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow

Privately divided
By a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go

Deep beneath the cover
Of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow

1557,1691.0,Red Hot Chili Peppers,Naked in the Rain,"Standin' on the corner of civilization
There's a time there's a place for me
In a world where I can't be found
Cold and mean people give me the creeps

Going to the jungle where the elephant roams
Got to get away gonna make it my home

Losing my taste for the human race
Social grace is a waste of time
It's absurd when I look around
So sublime that we blow my mind

Naked in the rain with a killer whale
I can't taste the salt when I lick his tail

Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it

I never met an animal that I didn't like
You can come to me I won't bite
Don't you know dog is man's best friend
There is some love that you can't fight

Naked in the rain with black tattoos
Runnin' through the woods laughing at the blues

Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it

Listen to the talking heart in my chest
With this gift good Lord I am blessed
There's a lump and it's in my throat
I'm in love with the wilderness

Naked in the river skinny dippin' my way
In the waterfall I just wanna play

Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it
Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it"

Wonder who they hatin' on lately
Baby it's him candy paint,
Gator skin seats call me Dun Dee
Up in your hood I'm the one that you wanna be
Haters wish they could feel the wood in my '83
Ridin' with no tint so the motherfuckers know it's me

Cats don't want her to keep that dress on

Take her to the telly and make her a victim

Best believe we gone forever
Don’t be the reason
Don’t be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever

We gone forever
We gone forever"

Calm yourself, he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three
You're sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

And you can see my heart.. beating
You can see it through my chest
I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger.....

Say a prayer to yourself
He says close your eyes, sometimes it helps
And then I get a scary thought
That he's here, means he's never lost

And you can see my heart.. beating
You can see it through my chest
I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger.....

As my life flashes before my eyes
I'm wondering if I will ever see another sunrise
So many won't get the chance to say goodbye
But it's to late to think of the value of my life

And you can see my heart.. beating
You can see it through my chest
I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger....."

Come on now what you waiting for, for, for?

Baby you got the keys-

Now shut up and drive

Then she said ""te amo""
Then she put her hand around my waist
I told her no, she cried ""te amo""
I told her I'm not gonna run away, but let me go

My soul is awry, without asking why
I said, ""te amo, wish somebody'd tell me what she said""
Don't it mean ""I love you""?
Think it means ""I love you""
Don't it mean ""I love you""?

Te amo, te amo, she's scared to breathe
I hold her hand, I got no choice
Pulled me out on the beach, danced in the water, I start to leave
She's begging me and asking why it's over

Then she said ""te amo""
Then she put her hand around my waist
I told her no, she cried ""te amo""
I told her I'm not gonna run away, but let me go

My soul is awry, without asking why
I said, ""te amo, wish somebody'd tell me what she said""

Don't it mean ""I love you""?

Listen we can dance, but you gotta watch your hands
Watch me all night, I'm movin' to the light because I understand
That we all need love and I'm not afraid
I feel the love, but I don't feel that way

Searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
cause it seems that wrong
really loves my company

He's more than a man
and this is more than love
the reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
because I'm gone again
and to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
and it kills him inside
to know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Everytime I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be... a murderer

I feel it in the air
as I'm doing my hair
preparing for another day
A kiss upon my cheek
as he reluctantly
ask if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long
just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
where I'm about to go
and we know it very well

Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
and it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Everytime I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be... a murderer

I might as well take a gun and put it to his head

I don't wanna do this anymore

This offence is all you live for
You're so down, you make me slow down
When I forgot you're just that way
You thought you're so bad, turn me away
I know why cuz when they wanted pictures of you

That you know just what to say
But words are only words
Can you show me something else?
Can you swear to me
That you'll always be this way
Show me how you feel
More than ever baby

I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't wanna know the lover at my door
Is just another heartache on my list
I don't wanna be angry no more
But you know I could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me know for sure
I don't wanna be lonely any more

Now It's hard for me
When my heart still on the mend
Open up to me
Like you do your girlfriends
You sing to me
And it's harmony
Girl what you do to me is everything
Make me say anything
Just to get you back again
Why can't we just try?

I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't wanna know the lover at my door
Is just another heartache on my list
I don't wanna be angry no more
But you know I could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me know for sure
I don't wanna be lonely any more

What if I was good to you?
What if you were good to me?
What if I could hold you till I feel you move inside of me?

What if it was paradise?
And what if we were symphonies?
What if I gave all my life
To find some way to stand beside you?

I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't wanna know the lover at my door
Is just another heartache on my lips
I don't wanna be angry no more
But you know I could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me know for sure
I don't wanna be lonely any more

You were there for summer dreaming
and you gave me what I need
and I hope you'll find your freedom

Yesterday when we were walking
You talked about your ma and dad,
What they did that made you happy,
What they did that made you sad.
We sat and watched the sun go down
Then picked a star before we lost
the moon
Youth is wasted on the young
before you know it's come and gone,too soon

You were there for summer dreaming
and you gave me what I need
and I hope you'll find your freedom
for eternity, for eternity

To sing this summer serenade

And have a drink or two

I can see it in your eyes
You still despise the same old lines
You heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you
For me it's true
And never seemed so right before

I practice every day to find some clever
lines to say
To make the meaning come true
But then I think I'll wait until the evening
gets late
And I'm alone with you

And oh the night's so blue

Sé que estoy haciendo cola
hasta que pienses si tienes tiempo
para pasar una tarde conmigo
y si vamos a algun sitio a bailar
sé que hay una posibilidad
de que no te marches sin mí
Entonces después pasamos por
un pequeño lugar tranquilo
y tomamos una copa o dos
y luego voy y lo estropeo todo
por decirte algo estúpido
Como te amo

Puedo ver en tus ojos
que desprecias las mismas palabras
que oíste la noche antes
y aunque esto sean sólamente
unas palabras a ti de mi,
es verdadero y nunca antes
he estado tan seguro de ello.

Practico cada día para
encontrar algunas palabras inteligentes
que decir para hacerte llegar su significado
pero entonces pienso que esperaré
hasta que la tarde sea noche
y yo esté solo contigo

Hace buen tiempo,
Su perfume llena mi cabeza
las estrellas se hacen rojas
y la noche es tan azul
y luego voy y lo estropeo todo
Por decirte algo estúpido
Como te amo te amo..."
1604,1793.0,Robbie Williams,Tripping,"First they ignore you
Then laugh at you and hate you
Then they fight you
Then you win

When the truth dies very bad things happen
They're being heartless again
I know its gone and there's going to be violence
I've taken as much as I'm willing to take
Why do you think we should suffer in silence?
When a heart is broken there's nothing to break

You've been mixing with some very heavy faces
The boys have done a bit of bird
They don't kill their own when they all love their mothers
But you're out of your depth son have a word

I know its gone and there's going to be violence
I've taken as much as I'm willing to take
Why do you think we should suffer in silence?
The heart is broken there's nothing to break

All is wonderful in this life
Dreaming of the sun she warms,
You should see me in the afterlife
Picking up the sons of dust

When you think we're lost we're exploring
What you think is what you're soon adoring
You don't want the truth the truth is boring
I've got this fever, need to
Leave the house
Leave the car
Leave the bad men where they are
I leave a few shells in my gun
N' its Got me staring at the sun....

I know its gone and there's going to be violence
I've taken as much as I'm willing to take
Why do you say we should suffer in silence?
My heart is broken there's nothing to break"

She's the kind of girl you wanna marry
The kind of girl you'd walk the whole world for
Put her on your back and just carry
Her attitude is hotter than the earth's core
When she's around nothing else matters
Untouchable, she's got her own forcefield
Sooner or later someone will get at her
If I don't someone else will

[Chorus - Robin Thicke] (2x)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you - girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you - girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you
Ohh! ohh! ohh! ohh! ohh! ohh! ohh! ohh!

[Verse - Robin Thicke]
She's the kind of girl you wanna marry
Scientists say that she's the second sunshine
And now my life is sweeter than berries
I guess if we have sex our love will turn to wine
When she's around nothing else matters
Even if the sky was at a stand still
If I turn my back then someone will get at her
If I don't someone else will

Uhh! picture this all
Picture my life and my intention to ball
Picture this ice and how it glitter for y'all
Now don't you feel claustrophobic when that chick is involved?
She changed your life - and your frame of mind
Sorry I hope what I'm saying is fine
We fuss but we take it one day at a time
If there's a fire you know that she'll lay in the line
I just, close my eyes and curve my mouth
Open my mind and words come out
You're eclectic, you're creative
You the picture girl I just painted
I got it, you name it, it's all paid for
Big castle on the sea shore, with the Willy Wonka decor
How this sound - Mr. and Mrs. Skateboard - P!

Will you be here in time?

In time
Whoooo
In time

How do I act differently
I thank you for asking
Stronger than I used to be
Or can you not imagine?

I see my soul reaching out
I hear your voice in the clouds
Is there no straighter line

A much straighter line
A place to jump in
I'm ready to fight

I see my soul reaching out
I hear your voice in the clouds
Is there no straighter line
I'm ready to win

I lie awake and watch her sleeping
She's lost in peaceful dreams
So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
And the thought crosses my mind
If I never wake up in the morning
Would she ever doubt the way I feel
About her in my heart

If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face this world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes

'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret
That my true feelings for them never were revealed
So I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel

If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face this world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last

It's a crazy world, but tonight's the right situation
Don't get left behind

I can feel the music moving through me everywhere
Ain't no destination, baby we don't even care
There's a place to be if you need the right education
Let it take you there

It's gone with the magic baby
I can see it there in your eyes(I can see it there in your eyes)
Let it flow, stop the waiting
Right here on the dance floor is where you gotta let it go

Don't stop movin'
Can you feel the music
DJ's got us going around, 'round
Don't stop movin'
Find your own way to it
Listen to the music
Taking you to places that you've never been before
Baby now

Don't stop moving to the pop pop beat (oh)
Don't stop moving to the S Club beat (yeah yeah yeah)

You can touch the moment, almost feel it in the air
Don't know where we're goin', baby we don't even care
Ain't no mystery, just use your imagination
Let it take you there

It's gone with the magic baby
I can see it there in your eyes (I can see it there in your eyes)
Let it flow, stop the waiting

1622,651.0,S Club 7,Have You Ever,"Sometimes it's wrong to walk away
Though you think it's over
Knowing there's so much more to say
Suddenly the moment's gone
And all your dreams are upside down
And you just wanna change the way the world goes round
Tell me

Have you ever loved and lost somebody
Wish there was a chance to say I'm sorry
Can't you see?
That's the way I feel about you and me, baby
Have you ever felt your heart was breaking
Lookin' down the road you should be taking
I should know
'Cause I loved and lost the day I let you go

Can't help but think that this is wrong
We should be together
Back in your arms where I belong
Now I finally realize, it was forever that I'd found
I'd give it all to change the way the world goes round
Tell me

Have you ever loved and lost somebody
Wish there was a chance to say I'm sorry
Can't you see?
That's the way I feel about you and me, baby
Have you ever felt your heart was breaking
Lookin' down the road you should be taking
I should know (I should know)
'Cause I loved and lost the day I let you go

I really wanna hear you say
That you know just how it feels
To have it all and let it slip away
Can't you see?
Even though the moment's gone
I'm still holding on somehow
Wishing I could change the way the world goes round
Tell me

Have you ever loved and lost somebody
Wish there was a chance to say I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
Can't you see? (oooh)
That's the way I feel about you and me, baby
Have you ever felt your heart was breaking
Lookin' down the road you should be taking

1624,1322.0,Sam Ragga Band,Die Welt steht still (feat. Jan Delay),"Lyrics: Die Welt Steht Still


Das ist Jan Delay zusammen mit Sam Ragga
Und die Welt steht still
Und die Welt steht still

Da heute einer dieser Tage ist
wo man zu gar nichts in der Lage ist
Man will nicht aufstehen, aber man muss pissen
Man will nicht rausgehen, aber man braucht Kippen
Das BÃ¼ro wird ins Bett verlegt
Der Alltag wird in BlÃ¤ttchen gedreht
Alles aufgehoben, alles aufgeschoben
Ich sag: Drauf geschissen
SpÃ¤ter drauf ist`s verboten

Die Welt steht still, sie steht still
Die Welt steht still, sie steht still
Denn die Welt steht still, sie steht still
Und die Welt steht still

Aber du kannst dich nicht immer verlassen auf morgen
Denn kriegst du Spinnenweben an den Beinen,
dann mach dir Sorgen
Wenn du SchweiÃŸausbrÃ¼che und GÃ¤nsehaut kriegst
sobald du nur einmal kurz aus dem Fenster raussiehst
Ich sag dir: Dann steht die Welt bald still fÃ¼r dich
Aber auf ewig und immer
Sie finden dich nach Monaten
vermodert und verwesen im Zimmer
aufm Bett zwischen Jointstummeln und Pizzaresten und Erbrochenem
Die Nachbarn, sie riefen die Bullen, es hatte so komisch gerochen, denn

Deine Welt stand still
Deine Welt stand still, sie stand still
Deine Welt stand still, sie stand still
Deine Welt stand still

Aber du kannst dich nicht immer verlassen auf morgen
Denn kriegst du Spinnenweben an den Beinen,
dann mach dir Sorgen
Ich sag: Aber du kannst dich nicht immer verlassen auf morgen
Denn kriegst du Spinnenweben an den Beinen,
dann mach dir Sorgen, mach dir Sorgen

Denn die Welt steht still (so niemand bewegt sich)
Ja die Welt steht still (und die Welt denkt, sie lebt nicht)
Ja die Welt steht still (und die Zeit vergeht nicht)
Denn die Welt steht still"
1625,377.0,Patti Smith,Dancing Barefoot,"She is benediction
She is addicted to thee
She is the root connection
She is connecting with he

Here I go and I don't know why
I fell so ceaselessly
Could it be he's taking over me...?
I'm dancing barefoot
Heading for a spin
Some strange music draws me in
Makes me come on like some heroine

She is sublimation
She is the essence of thee
She is concentrating on
He, who is chosen by she

Here I go and I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly
Could it be he's taking over me...?
I'm dancing barefoot
Heading for a spin
Some strange music draws me in
Makes me come on like some heroine

She is re-creation
She, intoxicated by thee
She has the slow sensation that
He is levitating with she ...

Here I go and I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly
'Til I lose my sense of gravity...
I'm dancing barefoot
Heading for a spin
Some strange music draws me in
Makes me come on like some heroine

(Oh god I fell for you...)

The plot of our life sweats in the dark like a face
The mystery of childbirth, of childhood itself
Grave visitations, what is it that calls to us?
Why must we pray screaming? Why must not death be redefined?
We shut our eyes we stretch out our arms, and whirl on a pane of glass
An affixation a fix on anything, the line of life the limb of a tree
The hands of he and the promise that he is blessed among women.

(Oh god I fell for you...)"

I haven't slept for a week
And I'm cold
Yeah I'm so cold
She's right
I should do somthing with my life
But I'm old, I'm old I'm getting old

Those eyes
She said they don't recognize me
Those lips
They're never calling my name

It feels heavy
It feels so heavy, heavy
I'm waiting for a saturday
I'm waiting for a saturday
And I'm too young to be old

Une fille jolie
Passait tout pres de moi
Elle arretait le temps
Au coin de st. catherine et st. laurent

Elle me regardait
Et elle souriait
Elle m'a fait penser a rien en ce moment
Mais comme le vent elle s'en allait
Et moi j'suis reveiller
Ouai moi j'suis reveiller"

I know they're stolen, but I don't feel bad.
I take that money, buy you things you never had.

Oh, baby, it would mean so much to me,
Oh, baby, to buy you all the things you need for free.
I'll buy you a jet plane, baby,
Get you on a higher plane to a jet stream
And take you through the stratosphere
And check out the planets there and then take you down
Deep where it's hot, hot in Arabia, babia,
Then cool, cold fields of snow
And we'll roll, dream, roll, dream, roll, roll, dream, dream.
When we dream it, when we dream it, when we dream it,
We'll dream it, dream it for free, free money,

If the fish swam out of the ocean
And grew legs and they started walking
And the apes climbed down from the trees
And grew tall and they started talking
And the stars fell out of the sky
And my tears rolled into the ocean
And now I'm looking for a reason why
You even set my world into motion

Coz if you're not really there
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
Coz if you're not really there
Then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold

Mmm

I look up into the night sky
I see a thousand eyes staring back
And all around these golden beacons
I see nothing but black
I feel the weight of something beyond them
I don't see what I can feel
If vision is the only validation
Then most of my life isn't real

Coz if you're not really there
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
Coz if you're not really there
Then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you

it was only you, nobody else but baby,
I know better now

Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In 77 and 69 revolution was in the air
I was born too late to a world that doesn't care
Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair

When the head of state didn't play guitar,
Not everybody drove a car,
When music really mattered and radio was king,
When accountants didn't have control
And the media couldn't buy your soul
And computers were still scary and we didn't know everything

Chorus

When popstars still remained a myth
And ignorance could still be bliss
And when God Saved the Queen she turned a whiter shade of pale
When my mom and dad were in their teens
and anarchy was still a dream
and the only way to stay in touch was a letter in the mail

Chorus

When record shops were on top
and vinyl was all that they stocked
and the super-info highway was still drifting out in space
kids were wearing hand me downs,
and playing games meant kick arounds
and footballers still had long hair and dirt across their face

I was born too late to a world that doesn't care
Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair"

When darkness is upon your door and you feel like you can't take anymore

Let me be the one you call
If you jump I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart
If you need to crash then crash and burn
You're not alone

When you feel all alone
And a loyal friend is hard to find
You're caught in a one way street
With the monsters in your head
When hopes and dreams are far away and
You feel like you can't face the day

Let me be the one you call
If you jump I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart
I can mend a broken heart

And when it's over you'll breathe again

1647,744.0,Scissor Sisters,I Don't Feel Like Dancin',"Wake up in the morning with a head like ‘what ya done?'
This used to be the life but I don't need another one
You like cuttin' up and carrying on, you wear them gowns
So how come I feel so lonely when you're up getting down?

So I play along when I hear that special song
I'm gonna be the one who gets it right
You better move when you're swingin' round the room
Looks like magic's solely ours tonight

But I don't feel like dancin'
When the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance
But my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up
A little soft-shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin'
No sir, no dancin' today

Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you break it down when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Rather be home with the one in the bed till dawn with you

Cities come and cities go just like the old empires
When all you do is change your clothes and call that versatile
You got so many colors, make a blind man so confused
Then why can't I keep up when you're the only thing I lose?

So I just pretend that I know which way to bend
And I'm gonna tell the whole world that you're mine
Just please understand when I see you clap your hands
If you stick around I'm sure that it'll be fine

But I don't feel like dancin'

My heart could take a chance

Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you break it down when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Rather be home with the one in the bed till dawn with you

You can't make me dance around
But your two-step makes my chest pound
Just lay me down
As you float away into the shimmer light

But I don't feel like dancin'
When the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance
But my two feet can't find a way
You think that I could muster up
A little soft-shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin'
No sir, no dancin' today

Don't feel like dancin', dancin' (I don't feel like dancin')

What do I have to do to make you understand?

For I'm the type of guy who gives girl the eye,

But I love them and I leave them,
break their hearts and deceive them everywhere I go.

1661,1488.0,Paul Simon,She Moves On,"I feel good
It's a fine day
The way the sun hits off the runway
A cloud shifts
The plane lifts
She moves on

But feel the bite
Whenever you believe that
You'll be lost and love will find you
When the road bends
And the song ends
She moves on

I know the reason I
Feel so blessed
My heart still splashes
Inside my chest, but she
She is like a top
She cannot stop
She moves on

A sympathetic stranger
Lights a candle in the middle of the night
Her voice cracks
She jumps back
But she moves on

She says ""Ooh my storybook lover
You have underestimated my power
As you shortly will discover""

The I fall to my knees
Shake a rattle at the skies
I'm afraid that I'll be taken
Abandoned, forsaken
In her cold coffee eyes

She can't sleep now
The moon is red
She fights a fever
She burns in bed
She needs to talk so
We take a walk
Down in the maroon light

She says ""Maybe these emotions are
As near to love as love will ever be""
So I agree

Then the moon breaks
She takes the corner that's all she takes
She moves on

She says ""Ooh my storybook lover
You have underestimated my power
As you shortly will discover""

Then I fall to my knees
I grow weak, I go slack
As if she captured the breath of my
voice in a bottle
And I can't catch it back

But I feel good
It's a fine day
The way the sun hits off the runway
A cloud shifts
The plane lifts
She moves on"

I feel so raped, so follow me down

Just fake it if you're out of direction
Fake it if you don't belong here
Fake it if you feel like infection
Whoa, you're such a fucking hypocrite

You used to know that the lies won't hide your flaws
No sense in hiding all of yours
You gave up on your dreams along the way, yeah

Good god, you're coming up with reasons
Good god, you're dragging it out
Good god, it's the changing of the seasons
I feel so raped, so follow me down

Just fake it if your out of direction
Fake it if you don't belong here
Fake it if you feel like infection
Whoa, you're such a fucking hypocrite

Whoa, whoa, whoa
[guitar solo]

I can fake with the best of anyone
I can fake with the best of them all
I can fake with the best of anyone
I can fake it all

Who's to know if your soul will fade at all
The one you sold to fool the world
You lost your self esteem along the way

Good god, you're coming up with reasons
Good god, you're dragging it out
Good god, it's the changing of the seasons
I feel so raped, man, follow me down

Just fake it if you're out of direction
Fake it if you don't belong here
Fake it if you feel like infection
Whoa, you're such a fucking hypocrite

Fake it if you're out of direction
Fake it if you don't belong here
Fake it if you feel like infection
Whoa, you're such a fucking hypocrite"

Where the riverboat swayed beneath the sun
Is where the river runs red
Like a King who stalks the wings and shoots a dove
And frees an eagle instead
It's more or less the same as the things that you said

I see trouble up the road
Like the things you found in love are by the way
And like to cheat on your soul
Like the best and worst of thoughts that lose control
Before you lie on your bed

It's more or less the same as the things that you said
Anyway for all the things you know tell me why does the river not flow
Anyway for all the things you said tell me why does the river run red
Anyway for all the things you've seen tell me when will the river run green
And anyway for all the things you know tell me why does the river not flow

It's more or less the things you fail to say in your way that's your trouble
Like a King who stalks the wings and shoots the moon and the stars
And his double
It's more or less the same as the things that you said
I see trouble up ahead
Where the river boat swayed beneath the sun

I see double - that's my trouble."

She makes a man wants to speak Spanish
Como se llama,si, bonita,si, mi casa
Shakira, Shakira

Oh baby when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

And I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby, this is perfection

Hey Girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing

And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl
And everything so unexpected - the way you right and left it
So you can keep on taking it

I never really knew that she could dance like this

Oh boy, I can see your body moving
Half animal, half man
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
But you seem to have a plan
My will and self restraint
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I am doing what I can, but I can't so you know
That's a bit too hard to explain

Baila en la calle de noche

I go back like when 'pac carried crates for Humpty Humpty
I need a whole club dizzy
Why the CIA wanna watch us?

I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
No more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats

1684,1493.0,Shakira,She Wolf,"S.O.S. she's in disguise
S.O.S. she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

A domesticated girl that's all you ask of me
Darling it is no joke, this is lycanthropy
The moon's awake now with eyes wide open
My body's craving, so feed the hungry

I've been devoting myself to you Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution or decent incentives to keep me at it
I'm starting to feel just a little abused like a coffee machine in an office
So I'm gonna go somewhere cozy to get me a lover
And tell you all about it

There's a she wolf in your closet
Open up and set her free
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

Sitting across a bar, staring right at her prey
It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
The moon's my teacher, and I'm her student

To locate the single men, I got on me a special radar
And the fire department hotline in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys that just want to enjoy
But having a very good time and behave very bad in the arms of a boy

There's a she wolf in the closet
Open up and set her free
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

S.O.S. she's in disguise
S.O.S. she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

S.O.S. she's in disguise
S.O.S. she's in disguise

Don't get me wrong, 'cause this might sound to you a bit odd
But you own the place where all my thoughts go hiding
Right under your clothes is where I'll find them

Underneath your clothes there's an endless story
There's the man I chose, there's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

'Cause of you, I forgot the smart ways to lie
Because of you, I'm running out of reasons to cry
When the friends are gone, when the party's over
We will still belong to each other

Underneath your clothes there's an endless story
There's the man I chose, there's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

Underneath your clothes there's an endless story
There's the man I chose, there's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl
For being such a hey, hey, hey, hey

I love you more than all that's on the planet
Movin' talkin' walkin' breathing
You know it's true, Oh babe it's so funny
You almost don't believe it
As every voice is hanging from the silence, lamps are hanging from the ceiling
Like a lady tied to her manners, I'm tied up to this feel...

Underneath your clothes there's an endless story
There's the man I chose, there's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

Underneath your clothes, ah wha ho oh woah
There's the man I chose, there's my territory

Lucky that my lips not only mumble
They spill kisses like a fountain
Lucky that my breasts are small and humble
So you don't confuse them with mountains
Lucky I have strong legs like my mother
To run for cover when I need it
And these two eyes are for no other
The day you leave will cry a river

By the way I made it through the day
I watch the world outside
By the way I'm leaving out today

I just saw Halley's Comet shooting
Said ""why you always running in place?""
Even the man in the moon disappeared
Somewhere in the stratosphere

[Chorus]
Tell my mother, tell my father
I've done the best I can
To make them realize
This is my life
I hope they understand
I'm not angry, I'm just saying
Sometimes goodbye is a second chance

Please don't cry one tear for me
I'm not afraid of what I have to say
This is my one and only voice
So listen close, it's only for today

I just saw Halley's Comet shooting
Said ""why you always running in place?""
Even the man in the moon disappeared
Somewhere in the stratosphere

Tell my mother, tell my father
I've done the best I can
To make them realize
This is my life

Here is my chance
This is my chance

Tell my mother, tell my father
I've done the best I can

1698,830.0,Shontelle,Impossible (single version),"I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did, I did

And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot
I did

And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won
You can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now

Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal's worse
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know

Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know, I know

And know when all is gone
There is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now

Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible!
Ooh impossible (yeah yeah)

Bright lights
Fancy restaurants
Everything in this world that a man could want
Got a bank account bigger than the law should allow

Pretty faces from the covers of the magazines
From their covers to my covers wanna lay with me
Fame and fortune still can't find
Just a grown man runnin out of time

I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women
All the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you

That without you girl my life is incomplete

Said without you girl ahh
Listen

Your perfume
Your sexy lingerie
Girl I remember it just like it was on yesterday
A Thursday you told me you had fallen in love
I wasn't sure that I was

It's been a year
Winter summer spring and fall
But bein without you just ain't livin ain't nothing at all
If I could travel back in time
I'd relive the days you were mine

Oh yeah that without you girl ahh

I just can't help lovin you
But I loved you much too late

And everything
To hear you say
That you'll stay

cupid don't fuck wit me!
Are you telling me this is a sign?
She's looking in my eyes, noticing no other guys
Are you telling me this is a sign?

[Snoop Dogg]
Don't think about it, boy leave her alone
(Oh ohhh!! yeah!) Nigga you ain't no G!
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll,
you ain't no G!


[Bridge - Uncle Charlie Wilson]
Nigga don't be young and foolish
You don't know what you're doing
You don't know what you've lost until she's gone (gone)
She Got a pretty face, drove you wild
But you ain't got that Snoop Doggy Dogg Style

[Chorus - Justin Timberlake]
I'm not sure what I see
Cupid don't fuck wit me!
Are you telling me this is a sign?
She's looking in my eyes, noticing no other guys
Are you telling me this is a sign? (OHHH!!!)

1720,1642.0,Snoop Dogg,Murder Was the Case (remix),"*helicopter flying overhead*
This is Angela Sanders coming to you live
from the scene of yet another murder mystery
It seems that entertainer Snoop Doggy Dogg has been murdered
We have no information at this time
*journalist speaks in spanish (I won't be insulting and try to transcribe it)*
*lightning cracks*
*helicopter passes by again*

As I look up, at the sky
My mind starts trippin, a tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shakin, and they breakin, tryin to save the Dogg
Pumpin on my chest and I'm screamin
I stop breathin, damn I see deamons
Dear God, I wonder can ya save me
I can't die my Boo-Boo's bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for prayin, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started sayin
&amp;quot;Bring your lifestyle to me I'll make it better&amp;quot;
And how long will I live?
&amp;quot;Eternal life and forever&amp;quot;
And will I be, the G that I was?
&amp;quot;I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes my son&amp;quot;
My eyes are closed

Murder... &amp;quot;murder was the case that they gave me&amp;quot; (repeat 4X)

I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my momma and my daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get, fronted some keys, to get, back on my feet
And everything that nigga said, came to reality
Livin like a baller loc
I'm havin money, and blowin hella chronic smoke
I bought my momma a Benz, my Boo-Boo a Jag
And now I'm rollin in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad
&amp;quot;Just remember who changed your mind
Cuz when you start set-trippin, that ass is mine&amp;quot;
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo'
Cause my eyes wanna journey some more, really doe (check it out)

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
I pray the lord, my soul to take

Murder was the case that they gave me
&amp;quot;Murder was the case that they gave me&amp;quot; (repeat 2X)

No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rollin on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with a izz-L, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
them niggaz from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad doggin niggaz cuz I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggaz stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scrapin on the floor
Niggaz gettin they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homey Baby Boo he took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it, to see twenty-two
I put that on my momma, I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

Murder... &amp;quot;murder was the case that they gave me&amp;quot; (repeat 4X)

1721,1993.0,Snoop Dogg,"Serial Killa (feat. D.O.C., RBX & Tha Dogg Pound)","Six million ways to die, choose one

Verse One: Kurupt, Daz

It's time to escape, but I don't know where the fuck i'm headed
Up or down, right or left, life or death
I see myself in a mist of smoke
Death becomes any nigga that takes me for a joke
We hit a five dollar stick, now we puttin in work
Unaccountable amounts of dirt, death becomes all niggaz
anybody killa, you know what the deal is
Nigga, you know what the real is

I see some mark brand niggaz on the corner flaggin me down
Sayin, ""Yo Daz, what's up with the Pound?
Is that nigga snoop alright? Aiyyo what's up with the crew?
Is them niggaz in jail, or are them niggaz through?""
i said, if you ain't up on thangs
Snoop Dogg is the name, Dogg Pound's the game
It's like this they don't understand
It's an everyday thang, to gangbang
Make that twist, don't be a bitch, let these niggaz know
What's up with you I represent the Pound and Death Row
And can't no other motherfucker in L.A. or Long Beach
and Compton, and Watts, see D-O-G's
Now, you can't come and you can't run, and you can't
see long to the G of the gang
One gun is all that we need, to put you to rest
Pump pump, put 2 slugs dead in your chest
Now you dead then a motherfucker, creepin and sleepin
6 feet deep in, fuckin with the Pound is

[RBX] Suicide, it's a suicide (4X)

Verse Two: Snoop Doggy Dogg

The cloud becomes black, and the sky becomes blue
Now you in the midst of the Dogg Pound crew
Ain't no clue, on why the fuck we do what we do
Leave you in a state of paranoia, oooh
Don't make a move for your gat so soon cuz
I drops bombs like Platoon (ay nigga)
Walk with me, hold my hand and let me lead you
I'll take you on a journey, and I promise I won't leave you
(I won't leave you) until you get the full comprehension
And when you do, that's when the mission
or survival, becomes your every thought
Keep your eyes open, cuz you don't wanna be caught
Half steppin with your weapon on safety
Now break yourself motherfucker 'fore you make me
take this 211 to another level
I come up with your ends, you go down with the devil
Now roam through the depths of hell
Where the rest your buster ass homeboys dwell
Well...

[RBX] Suicide, it's a suicide (4X)

Now tell me, what's my motherfuckin name
Serial killa, serial killa, serial killa

(Wake up in the morning, to Lucky Charms cereal)

Verse Three: RBX

Deep, deep like the mind of Minolta, now picture this!
Let's picnic inside a morgue
Not pic-a-nic baskets, pic-a-nic caskets
And I got the machine, that cracks your fuckin chest plates
open and release them guts
Then I release def cuts
Brutal, jagged edged, totally ruffneck
Now everybody scream nuff respect to the X
Nuff respect given
Disrespect and you will not be livin
Word to momma, Emma, drama, dilemma

[RBX] Suicide, it's a suicide (4X)

Now tell me, what's my motherfuckin name
Serial killa, serial killa, serial killa

Mi razon de vivir y me dejaste solo
Solo pensaste en ti, cuanta pasión te amaba
No me importó sufrir, aun asi te esperaba

Me cansè de esperarte a que te decidieras
Lo decidiste tarde y ya ves lo que queda


En mi no queda nada, nada de nada
Ni siquiera una huella de cuanto te amaba
Me cansè de rogarte que volvieras conmigo
pero lo hiciste tarde y ya no soy el mismo
Te creiste que eras la dueña del mundo
y me pusiste a prueba pisoteando mi orgullo
Te creiste reina en mi corazon
y ahora nada queda de aquel amor


De ti no queda nada, nada, nada
Ni siquiera una huella de cuanto te amaba
Te creiste reina en mi corazon
Y ahora nada queda de aquel amor


""Es que soy tu principe otra vez""


Me cansè de rogarte a que te decidieras

It's not the way you walk
And it ain't the way you talk
It ain't the job you got
That keeps me satisfied

Your love, it feels so good
And that's what takes me high
Higher than I've been before
Your love, it keeps me alive
Thought I should let you know
That your touch it means so much
When I'm alone at night
It's you I'm always thinking of

Oh, oh, baby

Oh, i want you to understand
How I feel, deep inside
Oh oh, you make me feel
All I need to feel

She looked awful nice and so I hoped she might take a chance

When we danced I held her tight
Then I walked her home that night
And all the stars were shining bright
And then I kissed her

Each time I saw her I couldn't wait to see her again
I wanted to let her know that I was more than a friend

I didn't know just what to do
And so I whispered I love you
And she said that she loved me too
And then I kissed her

I kissed her in a way that I'd never kissed a girl before
I kissed her in a way that I hope she liked for evermore

I knew that she was mine so I gave her all the love that I had
Then one day she'll take me home to meet her mom and her dad

Then I asked her to be my bride
And always be right by my side
I felt so happy that I almost cried
And then I kissed her

And then I kissed her

Look at myself straight

I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in pain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
I dream of fire
Those dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire
And in the flames
Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire

This desert rose
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this

And as she turns
This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams
This fire burns
I realise that nothing's as it seems

I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in pain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand

I dream of rain
I lift my gaze to empty skies above
I close my eyes, this rare perfume
Is the sweet intoxication of her love

I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in pain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand

Sweet desert rose
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this

Sweet desert rose
This memory of Eden haunts us all
This desert flower, this rare perfume
Is the sweet intoxication of the fall"

Doing all right

Should be waiting for the sun
Looking round to find the words to say
Should be waiting for the skies to clear
There ain't time in all the world

Should be waiting for the sun

Yesterday my life was in ruin
Now today God knows what I'm doing
Anyway I should be doing all right

Eleven coffees, Rickki Lake on play

Seven hours since you closed the door

Erased your number from my telephone
And if you call me I won't be at home

They say

You're in my face, sorry what's your name?
Takes more than begging to reverse my brain

No more, no more

Breaking off the buns
A brand new day has just begun
Just because you made me go ""ooh""
Doesn't mean I'll put up with you
Don't you dare come back
Can't u see I wont take that?
I ain't crying over you
Better fill your head up like I told you

what you sayin
It's not even like that
It wasn't like that but I saw you
Baby I don't love her
You don't love me
you know what I don't even want to talk to you
she don't mean nothing to me
I don't want to see ya face
I just want to see you walking thourgh that door
there ain't nothing else to say
peace""

Come home late
It seems you barely beat the sun
Tapping my shoulder thinking you gon get you some
Smelling like some fragrance that I don't even wear
So if you want some loving I suggest you go back there
Where you came from
Day to Day with you it's always something else
Working my nerve God knows that I don't deserve
What you put me through cause I been so true to you
For you to come at me with another lame excuse
See I .....

CHORUS:
Heard it all before (heard it all before)
All of ya lies, all of ya sweet talk
Baby this, Baby that
But your lies ain't working out
Look who's hurting now
See I had to shut you down (down)
I had to shut you down
Played the fool before (played the fool before)
I was your fool I believed in you
Yes I did yes I did
But your lies ain't working out (look who's hurting now)
See I had to shut you down (down)
I had to shut you down

What were you thinking bringing her into our home
In our bed, you must have fell and bumped your head
Messing up my sheets and violating me
Got me 'bout to call my peeps and take it to the streets
Nothing you can do
And there's nothing you can say
That could persuade me to stay with you another day
You have crossed the line to the point of no return
What you do from here on out
I am no longer concerned
See I......

Heard it all before (heard it all before)
Let me explain, baby, it's not what you think, that's what you said to me
But your lies ain't working out look who's hurting now
See I had to shut you down (down)
I had to shut you down
Played the fool before (played the fool before)
You got a good game I must admit I was it but it's over
But your lies ain't working out look who's hurting now
See I had to shut you down (down)
I had to shut you down

Use to hang on to your every word
But the more you lie to me the more I hurt
The things you use to say would sound so sweet
I was naive
Quick to believe

Heard it all before
I was at work, It wasn't my car you saw, baby, I swear it wasn't me
But your lies ain't working out look who's hurting now
See I had to shut you down (down)
I had to shut you down
Played the fool before (played the fool before)
You were my boo I trusted you for way too long (way too long)
But your lies ain't working out look who's hurting now (now)
See I had to shut you down
I had to shut you down

Heard it all before
You know you messed up you got to know you messed up
You got to go now say what you want
But your lies ain't working out look who's hurting now
See I had to shut you down (I had to shut you down)
Played the fool before

Yes i did and you ain't welcome no more

1751,455.0,Hermes House Band,I Will Survive (radio edit),"At first I was afraid, I was petrified,
Kept� thinkin� I could never live without you by my side,
But then I spent so many nights thinkin� how you did me wrong,
I grew strong, and I learned how to get along,

And so your back, from outer space,
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon yourface,
I should've changed that stupid lock,
I should've made you leave your key,
If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me,

Go on now go, walk out the door,
Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore,
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye,
Did you think I'd crumble, did you think I'd lay down and die,
Oh no not I, I will survive,
For as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive,
I've got all my life to live; I've got all my love to give,
And I'll survive, I will survive,

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart,
And trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart,
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself,
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high,
And you'll see me, somebody new,
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you,
And so you felt like droppin� in and just expect me to be free,
Now I'm savin� all my lovin� for someone who's lovin� me,

Go now go, walk out the door,
Just turn around now, cause� your not welcome anymore,
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye,
Did ya think I'd crumble, did ya think I'd lay down and die,

Oh no not I, I will survive,
For as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive,

Take me out, ya never could
Act up in my neighbourhood
You better not, my aim is good
The House Of Pain is not a gang
Just a funky Irish name
A Celtic savage makin' cabbage
With corn beef on the side
Irish pride is what I got
I got alot so don't dispute it
Constantly I'm suited
If ya got a gun then shoot it
Pick any beat I rock it
I'm always in the pocket
You try to ill, I grab my gat
And now you see my cock it
Next I pull the trigger
I don't care if you're bigger
You try to con yourself you're bulletproof
But how ya figure?
The caps that I'll be poppin'
They'll have your body droppin'
You thought you knew the deal
But now you feel your heartbeat stoppin'
I'm moppin' up the comp
That's short for compitition
I write my lyrics like
The Irish mob in Hell's Kitchen

The House Of Pain in effect, y'all
I say the House Of Pain is in effect
You know the House Of Pain is in effect y'all
And anyone that steps up in gettin' wrecked
I'm a beer drinkin' fighter
The bike in Easy Rider
I only roll my spliffs
With the extra easy whiters
Papers to vapors
Is what you'll all be catchin'
Meanwhile I'll be snatchin'
Up your hoes and all your dough
The styles that I'll be kickin'
You know they're finger lickin'
Good, the peckerwood never could play the victim
Only the offender
I go out on a bender
Drink a case of brew
And then disgrace the crew
But only if it's mickeys
I never wear no dickeys
Only wear the Levi's
My whole family cries

Smiling as the shit comes down
You can tell a man from what he has to say
Everything gets turned around
And I will risk my neck again, again

You can take me where you will
Up the creek and through the mill
Like all the things you can't explain
Four seasons in one day

Blood dries up
Like rain, like rain
Fills my cup
Like four seasons in one day

Doesn't pay to make predictions

Finding out wherever there is comfort there is pain

(Bring 'em out, bring 'em out) Aye!
(Bring 'em out, bring 'em out) T.I.
(Bring 'em out, bring 'em out) Aye!

[Verse 1]
TIP comin live from the VIP, heard the night life lost life when I leave
Both the Feds and the State wanna see my need
The whole city got bizzerk he got treat
Anotha nigga got a hit but shawty he not me
Who set the city on fire as soon as he got freed
Da king back now hoes don't even know how to act now
Hit the club stippers gettin naked 'fore I sat down
Still ballin money stack taller than Shaq now
Still push a button to let the roof on the 'Lac down
I'm on the road doin shows puttin my mack down
Mississippi to Philly Albuquerque to Chatt Town

[Hook]
I got the crowd yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, all my hotgirls yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, all the Dope Boyz yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, from the back they yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)

[Verse 2]
Once again what other rap nigga hooder than this
I got rich and I'm still on some hoolagin shit
You be rappin bout blow I was movin the shit
You talkin bout shootin out and I was doin the shit
If I hit you in the face you gon be suin and shit
And if I catch anotha case I know I'm true to be missed
So I'ma keep it cool head stay out of the news
Headlines and shows other rappers its bedtime (bedtime)
It's clear to see that I'm ahead of my time
I copped a chromed out hard top Carrerra to shine
I got some time, it ain't shit cause I get better wit time
Who got a flow and a live show better than mine

[Hook]
I got a packed house yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, all my hotgirls yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, all the Dope Boyz yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, from the back they yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)

[Verse 3]
Mic check 1-2 1-2, you wanna beef wit the king what is you gon do
Will you show up on the scene wit 2 guns drew
Or you and ya friend and play a little two on two
If you knew half of what I knew then you'll be hittin the deck
Got a tool and a vest I can get some respect
I'ma make it hard for a sucka nigga to flex
Sho 'em this ain't the squad for a nigga to test
Pimp my nutz too large and we way too fresh
Work well wit Nines AK's and Techs
And quick to check a lame like a game of chess
You want beef you can bring ya best and we'll be standin..

[Hook - 2X]
In ya front yard yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)

1763,389.0,T.I.,Dead and Gone (feat. Justin Timberlake),"[Chorus - Justin Timberlake]:
Ohh I've been travelin on this road too long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
Ohh I've been travelin on this road too long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone

[Verse 1 - T.I.]:
Ever had one of dem days you wish woulda stayed home
Run into a group of niggas getting they hate on
You walk by they get wrong you reply then shit get blown
Way outta proportion way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one then rush em
Figure you get your hair? that next
They dont wanna stop there now they buzzin
Now you gushin, ambulance rushin you to the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus ya hit 4 times plus it hit ya spine paralyzed waist down now ya wheel chair bound
Never mind that now you lucky to be alive, Just think it all started you fussin with 3 guys
Now ya pride in the way but ya pride is the way you could fuck around get shot die anyday
Niggas die every day all over bull shit dope money dice game ordinary hood shit
Could this be cuz of hip hop music or did the ones with the good sense not use it
Usually niggas don't know what to do when their back against the wall so they just start shootin
For red or for blue or for blow I guess, from Bankhead or from your projects
No more stress, now I'm straight, now I get it now I take
Time to think, before I make mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday the heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say the old me dead and gone away

[Chorus - Justin Timberlake]:
Ohh I've been travelin on this road too long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
Ohh I've been travelin on this road too long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone

[Verse 2 - T.I.]:
I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragedy
Situation coulda been dead lookin back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin
In apartments hangin smokin and rappin
Niggas start shit didn't next thing ya know we cappin
Get locked up then didn't even get mad
Now think about damn what a life I had
Most of that shit look back just laugh
Some shit still look back just sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more
Got enough dead homies I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his job, cost me more
I'da took that ass-whoopin now for sure
Now think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripes
A nigga put his hands on me alright
Otherwise stand there talk shit all night
Cuz I hit you, you sue me,
I shoot you, get locked up, who me?
No more stress, now I'm straight, now I get it now I take
Time to think before I make mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday the heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say the old me dead and gone away.

[Chorus - Justin Timberlake]:
Ohh I've been travelin on this road too long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
Ohh I've been travelin on this road too long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone

[Justin Timberlake]:
I turn my head to the east I dont see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north, swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone, the new me will be alright
I turn my head to the east I dont see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north, swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone, the new me will be alright

[Chorus - Justin Timberlake]:
Ohh I've been travelin on this road too long

Ohh I've been travelin on this road too long

Nevermind what haters say, ignore them ’til they fade away.
Amazing they ungreat for after all the game I gave away.
Safe to say I paved the way, for you cats to get paid today.
You still be wasting days away, nah had I never saved the day.
Consider them my protégé, how much I think they should pay.
Instead of being gracious, they violated and made you wait.
I never been a hater still I love them, yeah I graze the way.
Some say they so yay and no they couldn’t even work on Labor day.
It aint that they black or white, their hands of area in shades of grey.
I’m West side anyway, even if I left the day it fades away.
Some move away to make a way not move away cause they afraid.
I’ll go back to the hood and all you ever did was hate away.
I pray for patience but they make me want to face away.
Like I once made them scream, now I could make them plead their case away.
Been thuggin’ all my life, can’t say I don’t deserve to take a break.

When that chirp shawty chirp back
Louie nap sack where I'm holding all the work at
What you know about that {*3X*}
Hey I know all about that
Loaded 44 on the low where the cheese at
Fresh off the jet to the jects where the G's at
What you know about that {*2X*}
Hey what you know about that
Hey I know all about that

[Verse 1]
See me in your city sitting pretty know I'm shining dog
I ride with a couple latina brawds and a china doll
And you know how we ball
Riding in shiny cars
Walking inside a mall
Buy everything he saw
You know about me dog
Don't talk about me dog
And if you doubt me dog
You better out me dog
I'm throwed off slightly bro
Don't wanna fight me bro
I'm fast as lightening bro
You better use your Nike's bro
Know you don't like me cause
Your bitch most likely does
She see me on them dubs
In front of every club

Gave every hoe a hug
Niggaz don't show me mugz
Cause you don't know me cuz

[Verse 2]
Candy on the six four
Leather guts and fish bowl
Fifty on my pinky ring just to make my fist glow
Your bitches get low
Because I get dough
So what I'm rich hoe

What you talking shit for
You gotta run and hit for
Got you yelling and I thought you put out a gun hit for
But you's a scary dude
Believed by very few
Just keep it very cool
Or we will bury you
See all that attitude's, unnecessary dude
Cause you never carry tools not even square he cube
you got the people fooled, who see me on the tube
Whatever try the crew, they'll see you on the news

Fresh off the jet to the block
Burn a rubber with a top-pop
I'll pop and bust a shot and make the block hot
LA will got got
Cuz you are not hot

And it will not stop
A video or not that will bust it to the glock stop
drag you out that Bentley Coupe and take it to the chop shop
I know we not y'all
If it may pop off
I'll answer the question &quot;Will I get your block knocked off?&quot;
And what it is bro
Look out I will kill ya bro
I'm in your hood if you a gangsta what you here for
Somebody better get bro before he get sent for
You say you wanna squash it what you still talking shit for

You look just like the man
In the picture by our bed
The suspence is pounding and clouding up my head
I'm checkin' your clothes
And you wear the same size shoes
You sleep in his spot
And you're driving his car
But I don't know just who you are

1 - There's a stranger in my house
It took a while to figure out
There's no way you could be who you say you are
You gotta be someone else
Cuz he wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do
He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me
So I'm convinced there's a stranger in my house

I'm not sure who you are
Don't see your shadow around when you walk
U leave with no kisses
Goodbye with no words
If these walls could talk
They would have nothing to tell

So what could it be?
Is there someone immitating me?
Could she be taking my place?
Look me in the face
And tell me that I'm wrong
When I say...

Repeat 1

Pop quiz
Tell me where we first kissed
Tell me where my spot is
Tell me if I liked it, loved it
Or could it be
That the stranger is me
Have I changed so drastically?
Is it I want more for me?
And you remain the same

Making that face carved out of stone
Coping real hard with a losing hand
Sound of a dog choking on a chicken bone
It just can't be the way that you had things planned, my friend

Whenever you're ready, yeah yeah
Things could start to happen real fast
Whenever you're ready, my good friend
Sure we could get one built to last

And let me give you some good advice
What I'm gonna, gonna ask you now
You better think about it twice
While you're out cheating on your woman
There's something you never even thought of, and that is

Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love [(hear me now]
Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love

I've seen so, so many fellows
Fall in that same old bag
Thinking that a woman is made to,
To be beat on and treated so bad
Oh, fellows, let me ask you something
I'm sure that you never even dreamed of,
[repeat chorus]

I know there are some women gives the other excuse
I'm not tryin' to run your life, boy it's up to you
Oh, you oh, you,

Reason why I ask this question
I used to be the same old way
When I decided to straighten up
I found it was a bit too late
Oh, that's when it all happened
Something I never, never dreamed of

Somebody was-a lovin' my old lady
While I was out making love
Somebody was-a lovin' my old lady
While I was out making love
Now who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love

With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion
I want to stop (stop) and thank you baby
I want to stop (stop) and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I close my eyes at night
Wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was just a bore
Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brighten up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop (stop)and thank you baby
I just want to stop (stop) and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you

You were better to me than I was to myself
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else

Over a shining sea
More than the steaming green
More than the shining eyes

Well they tell me it's only a drea in Rio
Nothing could be as sweet as it seems
On this very first day down
They remind me
Son have you so soon forgotten
Often as not it's rotten inside
And the mask soon slips away
Strange taste of a tropical fruit
Romantic language of the portugese
Melody on a wooden flute
Samba floating in the summer breeze

Take it easy

It's alright you can stay asleep
You can close your eyes
You can trust the people of paradise
To call your keeper
And tender your goodbyes

Oh what a night
Wonderful one in a million
Frozen fire brazilian stars
Oh holy southern cross
Later on
Take me way downtown in a tincan
I cant come down from the bandstand
I'm never thrown for souch a loss
When they say

Quando a nossa mae acordar
Andareimos au sol
Quando a nossa mae acordar
Cantara pelos sertao
Quando a nossa mae acordar
Todos os filios saberao
Todos os filios saberao
E regozijarao

Caught in the rays of the rising sun
On the run from the soldiers gun
Shouting out loud from the angry crowd
The mild the wild and the hungry child

I'll tell you
It's more than a dream in Rio
I was there on the very day
And my heart came back alive

There was more
More than the singing voices
More than the upturned faces
And more than the shining eyes
But it's more than the shining eye
More than the steaming green
More than the hidden hills
More than the concrete christ
More than a distant land
Over a shining sea
More than the hungry child
More like another time
Born of a million years
More than a million yers"

She's going off about something that you said

It's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey isn't this easy

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say your fine
I know you better then that
Hey whatcha doing with a girl like that

She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know
Baby
You belong with me
You belong with me

Oh
I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know your about to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along
So why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time
How could you not know
Baby you belong with me
You belong with me

You belong with me

Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me

You belong with me"

I don't give a fuck 'bout your fault or mishappenin's,
Nigga we from the Bronx, New York... shit happens,
Kids clappin' love to spark the place,
Half the niggas on the squad got a scar on they face,
It's a cold world, and this is ice,
Half a mil' for the charm, nigga this is life.
Got the phantom in front building Trinity Ave.
10 years been legit they still figure me bad.
As a youngin', I was too much to cope with.
Why you think, mo'fuckers nick-named me, Cook Coke shit.
Should've been called Don robbery, extorsion or maybe grand larceny...
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle,
This long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble.
Came out the gate, no I didn't flow Joe shit.
Fat nigga with shotty was the logo kid.

[Chorus]
Said my niggas don't dance,
we just pull up the pants and,
Do the Roc-away.
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.
I said my niggas don't dance,
See we just pull up the pants and,
Do the Roc-away.
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.

R to the E'zzy',
M to the whizz-i [Y],
My arms stay breezy,
The Don's stay fizz-i,
Got a date at 8, the day I was in the 740'fizz-i,
And I just bought a bike so I can ride til' I die,
With a matchin' jacket,
Bout' to cop me a mansion,
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'.
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance- we boogie,
So nevermind how we got in here with the burners and hoodies.
Listen we don't pay admission,
And bouncers don't check us,
And we walk around the metal detectors.
And there really ain't no need for a VIP section in the middle of the dance floor,
Reckless, check it, said it?!
Like my necklace, started relaxin' now, that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction.
See, money ain't a thing nigga, we still the same nigga, flows just changed
now we 'bout to change the game nigga.

[Chorus]
Said my niggas don't dance,
we just pull up the pants and,
Do the Roc-away.
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.
I said my niggas don't dance,
we just pull up the pants and,
Do the Roc-away.
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.

[Verse 3 - Fat Joe a.k.a Joey Crack]
Now we livin' better now,
Gucci sweater now,
And that G4 could fly through, any weather now,
See niggas get tight, when you worth some millions.
That's why I sport the chincilla to hurt they feelin's.
Your can find Joe Crack at all type of shit,
Out at Vegas front roll on all the fights and shit,
If I visited Compton, they'd prolly squeel.
'Cause half these rappers dead broke like dirick fa' real.
If you cross the line damn right, I'm gon' hurt you,
These faggot niggas even made gang signs commercials.
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up,
B2K crip walkin' like that's what's up.
Kay keep tellin' me to speak about rucker,
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the rucker,
Not even Pee-Wee Kirkland could imagine this,
My niggas didn't have to play to win the championship.

[Chorus]
my niggas don't dance,
we just pull up the pants and,
Do the Roc-away.
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.
I said my niggas don't dance,
we just pull up the pants and,
Do the Roc-away."

Who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone, you'll need love to light the shadows on your face.
If a greater wave shall fall and fall upon us all,
Then between the sand and stone could you make it on your own.

If I could, then I would.
I'll go wherever you will go.
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go.

And maybe, I'll find out a way to make it back someday,
To watch you, to guide you, through the darkest of your days.
If a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all,
Well, then I hope there's someone out there
who can bring me back to you.

If I could, then I would.
I'll go wherever you will go.
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go.

Run away with my heart.
Run away with my hope.
Run away with my love.

I know now, just quite how,
My life and love might still go on.
In your heart, in your mind, I'll stay with you for all of time.

If I could, then I would.
I'll go wherever you will go.
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go.

If I could turn back time,
I'll go wherever you will go.
If I could make you mine,
I'll go wherever you will go.
I'll go wherever you will go."

1812,727.0,The Fray,How To Save A Life,"Step one: you say we need to talk
He walks you say sit down it's just a talk
He smiles politely back to you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you
And pray to God he hears you

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or brake with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
How to save a life
How to save a life

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night

Where the West was all but won
All alone, smoking his last cigarette
I said, ""Where've you been?"" He said, ""Ask anything.""

Where were you, when everything was falling apart.
All my days were spent by the telephone that never rang
And all I needed was a call that never came
To the corner of 1st and Amistad

Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me
Lying on the floor, surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait? Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late, you found me, you found me.

But in the end everyone ends up alone
Losing her, the only one who's ever known
Who I am, who I'm not and who I wanna to be
No way to know how long she will be next to me

Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me
Lying on the floor, surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait? Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late, you found me, you found me.

The early morning, the city breaks
And I've been calling for years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never sent me no letters
You got some kind of nerve taking all I want

Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me
Lying on the floor, Where were you? Where were you?

Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me

Ya, let's take em back
Uh huh

Comin up I was confused my momma kissin a girl
Confusion occurs comin up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around probably out commitin felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing ch-check out my melody
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope for a fo-finger ring
One of them gold ropes
NaNa told me if I pass could get a sheep skin coat
If I can move a few packs and get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning niggas done stole my bike
Different day same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

[Chorus (50 then Game):]
Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop

Go head' envy me
I'm raps MVP
And I ain't goin nowhere so you can get to know me

Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop

Go head' envy me
I'm raps MVP
And I ain't goin nowhere so you can get to know me

[Game]
On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides right above the gold wires
I'll fo-five em
Kill a nigga on my song but really do it
Thats the true meaning of a ~ghostwriter~
10 g'z will take ya daughter out of Air Forces
Believe you me homie i know all bout losses
I'm from Compton where the wrong colors be cautious
One phone call will have ya body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats
Been bangin since my lil nigga Rob got killed for his Barkley's
That's 10 years I told Pooh in 95' I'd kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95s
Told Banks when i met him imma ride
And if I gotta die rather homicide
I ain't have 50 Cent when my Grandmomma died
Now i'm goin back to Cali with my Jacob on
See how time fly?

[Chorus - 50 Cent]

From the beginnin to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in
Is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me nigga now listen to Game

[Game]
Used to see 5-0 throw the crack by the bench
Now i'm fuckin with ~5-0~ it's all startin to make ~sense~
My moms happy she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waitin on Sha Money to land sittin in the Range
Thinkin how they spend 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin
Pac is gone and Brendas still throwin babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's goin on like i hear Marvin
No school books they use that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and i get exhausted
I think what if Marie Banker got that abortion
I love ya Ma'

No sleep, until I'm done with finding the answer

I've been searching, I've been living
For tomorrows all my life

But I, I'd rather kill myself than turn into their slave

Somehow I just don't wanna stay and wait for a wonder

I've been watching, I've been waiting
In the shadows for my time
I've been searching, I've been living
For tomorrows all my life

Lately, I've been walking, walking in circles
Watching, waiting for something
Feel me, touch me, heal me
Come take me higher

And what she finna have she don't know
She want neo-soul, this hip-hop is old
She don't want no rock-n-roll
She want platinum or ice or gold
She want a whole lotta somethin' to fold
If you a obstacle she just drop ya cold
Cuz one monkey don't stop the show
Little Mary is bad
In these streets she done ran
E'er since when the heat began
I told the girl look here
Calm down I'ma hold your hand
To enable you to peep the plan
Cuz you is quick to learn
And we can make money to burn
If you allow me the latest game
I don't ask for much, but enough room to spread my wings
And the world finna know my name

[Verse 2: Cody Chesnutt]
I don't ask, for much these days
And I don't bitch, and whine, if I don't get my way
I only wanna fuck another behind my lover's back
I sit and watch it grow standin' where I'm at
Fertilize another behind my lover's back
And I'm keepin' my secrets mine
I push my seed in her bush for life
Its gonna work because I'm pushin' it right
If Mary drops my baby girl tonight
I would name her Rock-N-Roll

Where we headin for she don't know

I don't break I can hold the chrome
And this weighin' a ton and I'm a son of a gun
My code name is The Only One and Black Thought is bad
These streets he done ran ever since when the game began
I never played the fool
Matta fact I be keepin' it cool
Since money been changing hands
And I'm left to shine, but the legacy that I leave behind be the seed
that'll keep the flame
I don't ask for much but enough room to spread these wings
And the world finna know my name

For no rich man
And I don't scream, and kick, when his shit don't fall in my hands, man

I was waiting in the queue lookin at the board
Wondering whether to have a burger or chips
Or what the shrapnel in my back pocket could afford
When I noticed out the corner of my eye
Lookin toward my direction your eyes locked on my course
I couldnt concentrate on what I wanted to order
Which lost me my place in the queue I waited for,yeah

I think you are really fit
Your fit but my gosh dont you know it

Picturing myself pulling with bare white-heart witt
Staring at you standing there That was it!
Whether or not you knew it I swear you didn't tick
And when that bloke in the white behind us lot queing was clocking onto you to it
I had to admit that yea yea you are fit and I do want it
But I stopped sharkin a minute to get chips and drinks

Im not trying to pull you
Even tho I would like to
I think you are really fit
Your fit but my gosh dont you know it

Now, i bashed my head hard earlier, due to the brew,
but i am digressing slightly so i'll continue
i didnt wanna bowl over all geezer and rude
not rude like good but just rude like uncouth
you girls think you can just flirt and it comes to you
well let me tell you see yes yes you are really rude
and rude as in good i knew she said as she queued
but i just did not wanna give the satisfaction to you

Im not trying to pull you
Even tho I would like to
I think you are really fit
Your fit but my gosh dont you know it

Oi just as you started to make your big advance
With the milkshake and that little dohnut in hand
I was like nah, I cant even, no you look grand
But you looked sharp there smiling hard suggesting and,
leaning away with your hearty hearty lookin tan
But i admit the next bit was spanners to my plan
You walked toward my path but just brushed right past
And into the arms of that fucking white shirted man

Im not trying to pull you
Even tho I would like to
I think you are really fit
Your fit but my gosh dont you know it

What do i give a fuck I've got a girlfriend anyway
(Woah! We've all had a drink mate!)
Oi were all a bit drunk weve had a few fair play
I'v got this stella i bombed from that last cafe
This nights not even begun
Yes yes oh yay

I did fancy you a bit though,yea i must say
I would rather i hadnt mugged myself on display
But this is just another case of female stopping play
In an otherswise total result of a holiday

Im not trying to pull you
Even tho i would like to
I think you are really fit
Your fit but my gosh dont you know it

Hahaheheh!

You're fit but you know it!!
You're fit but you know it!!
I think i'm going to fall over!!

Holding back, everyday the same
Don't wanna be a loner
Listen to me, oh no
I never say anything at all
But with nothing to consider they forget my name

I'm the last chick standing up against the wall
Keep up, falling, these heels they keep me boring
Getting clamped up and sitting on the fence now

So alone all the time and I
Lock myself away

Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette
And a message coming from my eyes says leave it alone

Don't want to hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the hounds of Hell
And if I catch you coming back my way
I'm going to serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do
And a feeling coming from my bones says find a home

I'm going to Wichita
Far from this opera, forever more
I'm going to work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleeding and I'm bleeding and I'm bleeding

And I will sing no more
And the stains coming from my blood tell me go back home"

Fall back again, fall back again,
Fall back again, fall back again

Oh, life it seems a struggle between
What we think what we see
I'm not going to change my ways
Just to please you or appease you
Inside a crowd, five billion proud
Willing to punch it out
Right, wrong, weak, strong
Ashes to ashes all fall down
Look around about this round
About this merry-go-round around
If at all God's gaze upon us fall
His mischievous grin, look at him

Forget about the reasons and
The treasons we are seeking
Forget about the notion that
Our emotions can be swept away
Forget about being guilty,
We are innocent instead
For soon we will all find our lives swept away

Sit awhile with TV's hungry child
Big belly swelled
Oh, for a price of a coke or a smoke
Keep alive those hungy eyes
Take a look at me, what you see in me,
Mirror look at me
Face it all, face it all again

Forget about the reasons and
The treasons we are seeking
Forget about the notion that your emotions can be
Wept away, kept at bay
Forget about being guilty, I am innocent instead
For soon we will all find our lives swept away

You seek up an emotion
And our cup is overflowing
You seek up an emotion,
Sometimes your well is dry
You seek up a big monster
For him to fight your wars for you
But when he finds his way to you, the devil's not
Going--ha, ha

Say, say

Look at me in my fancy car
And my bank account
Oh, how I wish I could take it all down
Into my grave, I'd save
Take a look again, take a look again,
Take a look again
Everyday things change...stay the same

Forget about the reasons and
The treasons we are seeking
Forget about the notion that
Your emotions can be swept away
Intentions are not wicked,
Don't be tricked into thinking so
Soon we will all find our lives swept away

You seek up an emotion
And our cup is overflowing
You seek up an emotion,
Sometimes your well is dry
You seek up a big monster
For him to fight your wars for you
But when he finds his way to you,
The devil's not going - ha, ha

But if anyone can make it,
I’m betting on me and you.

Just keep on moving into me.
I know you’re gonna see,
The best is yet to come.

CHORUS:
Don’t fear it now we’re going all the way.
That sun is shining on a brand new day.
It’s a long way down and it’s a leap of faith,
But I’m never giving up,
‘Cause I know we got a once in a lifetime love.

Everybody’s looking for what we found.
Some wait their whole life,
And it never comes around

So don’t hold back now just let go,
On all you’ve ever known.
You can put you’re hand in mine.

CHORUS

I close my eyes and I see you standing right there.
Saying “I do” and they’re throwing the rice in our hair.
Well the first one’s born and a brother comes along and he’s got your smile.

You're right, our love was so wrong.

Listen girl, who do you think I am
Don't you know that he was my man
But I chose to let him go
So why do you act like I still care about him
Looking at me like I'm hurt
When I'm the one who said I didn't want it to work
Don't you forget I had him first

(Bridge)
What you thinkin', stop blaming me
He wasn't man enough for me
If you don't know now here's your chance
I've already had your man
Do you wonder just where he's been, yeah
Do not be worried about him
Now it's time you know the truth
I think he's just the man for you

(Chorus)
What are you thinking
Do you know about us back then
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend
I'm not thinking 'bout him, but you married him
Do you know I made him leave
Do you know he begged to stay with me
He wasn't man enough for me

Listen girl, didn't he tell you the truth
If not then why don't you ask him
Then maybe you can be more into him
Instead of worrying about me
And hopefully you won't find
All of the reasons why his love didn't count
And why we couldn't work it out

(Bridge)
(Chorus)

Oh yeah, so many reasons why our love is through, yeah
What makes you think he'll be good to you, no
It makes no sense 'cos he will never change
Girl you better recognise the game

Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey
Since the return from her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey

Tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated

Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, hey
She checks out Mozart while she does tae-bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey

Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' jane
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Can you imagine your love fried, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine your first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone
Conversation, the best soy latte that you ever had
And me

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back toward the Milky Way

Tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights are faded
And that heaven is overrated

Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star

And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself?

So I can call you later on,on your phone or something
Take you home, and maybe we could bone or something
It's no limits to what we do,cause tonight we cutting, gut busting
I'm digging in your walls something viscious
With your legs to the ceiling, catch a nut someting serious
You delirious,or might I say you taste so delicious
With your pretty brown skin, like Almond Joys and Kisses

In and out of your jaws, I was beating down your walls
Had your ass breaking laws for a player was the cause
And every time you seen a G you was slipping off your drawers, I recall
I met your ass at the mall, in the fall
You the one with the dress on, let me take you home
Show your ass how to buss a nut, up in the guts
Cut you up like you ain't been cut

Maybe we can exchange numbers and hook up in the week
Oh, You a freak, I knew it from the first time I saw you
The way you played with your tongue, I knew right then I would call you
So what it is, they call me Super Don from the ville
And I'ma tell you like this, cause a nigga so real, and stay trill
Cause all I wanna do is just drill, with that ass in the air, and the pussy I kill

He's so persuasive, and I'm his lady

Oh! Tonight he's waitin, and I ain't complainin
I'm entertainin, my number one fan
My back is achin, from our love makin
Oh yes I'm takin, ain't no use in fakin
My ups, my downs, my high and my lows
From head to toe, he makes me glow
He hits the spot, he makes me hot

He's so contagious, he turns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I waited for
He keeps me guessin, spontaneous
He's so persuasive, and I'm his lady

[Verse 3: Rakim]
Thinkin of a masterplan, you know anything you need baby ask your man
You was there from a half a grand
Now it's kelos to c notes and how fast your grands
We ball like we own the world, your only concern is you my only girl
And when we speakin in tongues
Breathin hard when I'm squeezin your lungs
Keep it strong, but I gotta hit the streets when I'm done
It's joy and pain, when you try to get ahead of the game
It's fucked up but you never complain
You just pray I don't get killed when I hit the hood
Just another hundred mill and I'm a quit for good
No more drug wars trips to jail and shootouts
Gettin loot out for lawyers and bail will get you boot out
Just me and you high off sex I'm twisted
You OG'd and you OD addicted

[Chorus: Truth Hurts]
He's so contagious, he turns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I waited for
He keeps me guessin, spontaneous
He's so persuasive, and I'm his lady
He's so contagious, he turns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I waited for

I came home, say, around a quarter to three
Still so high
Hypnotized
In a trance
From the start it, so butter and brown and tantalizing
You woulda thought I needed help from this feeling that I felt
So shook I had to catch my breath

Swallow my pride

Taking you home to the crib, in the Chi
And everytime I see your thighs, I cry when I drive by
Watching you should be a thrill, got the fellas
Hustling trying to get, steady screaming my-my-my-my
Walk on the carpet, with the bells that flick in the dark
Kicking it on the couch, at 106 & Park

[Intro]
When I wake up in the mornin� love,
And the sunlight hurts my eyes,
Then somethin� with out warnin� love,
Bears heavy on my mind

[Twista]
Let's get them dollars, Let's get this money

[Verse 1 (Twista)]
I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind,
I got my finger on tha trigga, stayin' on tha grind,
And when I wake up in the mornin', I got's to hit a lick,
Saw the 2000 and 3 Navi, on Sprees wit' a kit,
Soon as my eyes see tha sunshine,
My thoughts is jukin' the block, and dodgin' the one time,
Peep how we movin' the rocks and wit' pounds of dro before I double my shit,
I can serve sixteen ounces for six and get back ninety-six,
A killa for tha skrilla, Nigga, Best not be stalkin',
I got's to get them bigga, figga's, fuck what you talkin',
I represent them nigga's ballin' wit' jewelry full of zickels,
Down to the nigga's chasin' million, their dreams' servin' nickels,
And I know, one day, I'm gon' come up,
And when you see me, don't hate, that I rolled up,
Get paid whether you legit when you slang, or tippin' off 'cane,
Until I take a dip in the Range, I'm flippin' them thangs,
Gotta get that money man

[Chorus (Anthony Hamilton)]
It's a lovely day, just got paid,
Stack it up, be on my way,
It's Lovely day, lovely day,
Lovely day, lovely day,
It's a lovely day, just got paid,
Stack it up, be on my way,
Lovely day, lovely day,
Lovely day

[Verse 2 (Twista)]
A hustler's definition, is a hustler for scratch,
You serve a motherfucker, you serve him for that,
I'm makin' money off of verses when I spit 'em on tracks,
And if I ain't sellin' no records, I'm servin' them packs,
I got a, clip full of hollows, money makin's my motto,
Semi-auto and Marlboros in the bottle, 'til I hit the lotto,
Wit' dreams of ownin' a records label, flippin' words,
My nigga flippin' buildin's better than he was flippin' birds,
I got tha, mentality and tha motive I'm on a mission,
For tha money, you can get it too, it's all about yo ambition,
Play yo position, provide the plans, and follow procedures,
In tha six-hundred, blunted, wit' a pocket full of hundred's and Visa's,
Love, when I get that dust, hit 'em up, re-cock then I get back up,
Love, when I get that gig, get a crib, get a car when tha grip stack up,
It's still in the evenin' if I'm sleepin' paper problems,
Soon as I get up it's just another day, another dollar
Gotta get that money man

[Chorus (Anthony Hamilton)]
It's a lovely day, just got paid,
Stack it up, be on my way,
Lovely day, lovely day,
Lovely day, lovely day,
It's a lovely day, just got paid,
Stack it up, be on my way,
Lovely day, lovely day,
Lovely day

[Verse 3 (Twista)]
Got love for the corporate playas that's ballin' rollin' jags,
Got love for the thug nigga's who get' it on tha ave.,
Love for those, who can make a mil and sit back and laugh,
And love for the fine stripper's who get it poppin' ass,
Love for the single parent's that's workin' through the struggle,
Love for those who gotta make a livin' movin' muscle,
Love for those who gotta watch tha hater's rollin' bubbles,
Causin' trouble every time a young brotha try to hustle,
And if I can't, legally make or not
Then I gotta get, right back on the block
And if it no work we do a stick-up and whip-up a concoction,
Might leave yo face down in the dirt because hurtin's not an option
Gotta get that money man

[Chorus (Anthony Hamilton) x2]
It's a lovely day, just got paid,
Stack it up, be on my way,
Lovely day, lovely day,
Lovely day, lovely day,
It's a lovely day, just got paid,
Stack it up, be on my way,
Lovely day, lovely day,
Lovely day

 Hoping his son fell under a different cloud
 I'm speaking directly into the crowd
 Nothing personal
 Just thought you would love to know the person
 Far from perfect
 But nearly word perfect
 Must be he weighed him
 On a scale form 1 to me, me
 Even the greatness
 Money equal a every 10 haters
 The rest couldn't make it though the unlikely behavior
 So be patient
 Or end up the next patient

 And I'm shooting on safety aiming for greatness

I was driving you was walking and I scooped you up
from that moment on I knew you were the one
I was single you was lonely and we fell in love
we would sit and talk for hours about anything
Baby you hang up, no you hang up, on three hang up
I bought your whip I paid your rent, I gave you everything
said you'd always be my baby then you bounce

Chorus:
How you gonna up and leave me now
How you gonna act like that
how you gonna change it up, we just finished making up
How you gonna act like that
How you gonna act like we dont be making love
you know we be tearing it up,
Breakin stuff
that ghetto love
how you gonna trip
how could you forget
how you gonna act like that

Girl I never thought that loving you would hurt
I did everything a good man would to make it work
girl you should have told me you had second thoughts
Like before I put the down on the house we bought
now I'm thinking you and me was a mistake
but then it hits me and I'm missing all the love we made
girl I know we that been going thru some thangs
but the sun is some where shining even when it rains

I'll be the one you kick it to
I'll be the one that misses you
I'll be the one to ease your pain
I'll be the one you want again
You'll be the one I can't forget
You'll be the one that's innocent
You'll be the one I can't deny
You'll be the one that makes me cry

You know I'm willing to do anything just to keep you in my heart
I messed around and gave up everything
I thought we'd never part
I was a player and I made the choice to give my heart to you

You don’t have to put up a fight
You don’t have to always be right
Let me take some of the punches
For you tonight

Listen to me now
I need to let you know
You don’t have to go it alone

And it’s you when I look in the mirror
And it’s you when I don’t pick up the phone
Sometimes you can’t make it on your own

We fight all the time
You and I… that’s alright
We’re the same soul
I don’t need… I don’t need to hear you say
That if we weren’t so alike
You’d like me a whole lot more

Listen to me now
I need to let you know
You don’t have to go it alone

And it’s you when I look in the mirror
And it’s you when I don’t pick up the phone
Sometimes you can’t make it on your own

I know that we don’t talk
I’m sick of it all
Can - you - hear - me – when – I -
Sing, you’re the reason I sing
You’re the reason why the opera is in me…

Where are we now?
I’ve got to let you know
A house still doesn’t make a home
Don’t leave me here alone...

And it’s you when I look in the mirror
And it’s you that makes it hard to let go

Sometimes you can’t make it

Sometimes you can’t make it on your own"

If It Was Considered A Classic Before The Drastic Change In Production When Cars Were Metal Instead Of Plastic Value
Is Wat I'm Talkin About
Take Two Of These And Walk It Out
You Be The Reason They Talk It Out
You Cant Be The King In The Parkin Lot-- Forever
Not Sayin I'm The Best But Till They Find Sumthin Better
I Am Here No Fear Right Me A Letter 'till Then
I Walk It Out [x7] I Westside Walk It O-O-Out [x3] Then Eastside Walk It O-O-Out

But I'm With Jones That Phat Stacks And Benjamin

See I Was Up In Cali Crip Walkin It All Night Long

Gettin' my way for years
In my career
And every lover
In and out my life
I've hit, loved and left in tears
Without a care
Until I met this girl who turned the tables around
She caught me by surprise
I never thought I'd be the one breaking down
I cant figure it out why

Be careful who you do cuz karma comes back around
Same ol' song
But I was so sure
That it wouldnt happen to me
Cuz I know how to put it down
But I was so wrong
This girl was mean
She really turned me out
Her body was so tight
I'm lookin' for her in the daytime with a flashlight
My homies say this girl is crampin' my style
And I can't figure it out but

Morning, just another day
Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized
how happy you made me oh Mandy

Well you came and you gave without taking
but I sent you away, oh Mandy
well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

I'm standing on the edge of time
I've walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world of uphill climbing
The tears are in my mind
And nothing is rhyming, oh Mandy

Well you came and you gave without taking
but I sent you away, oh Mandy
well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

Yesterday's a dream I face the morning
Crying on a breeze
the pain is calling, oh Mandy

Well you came and you gave without taking
but I sent you away, oh Mandy
well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

You came and you gave without taking
but I sent you away, oh Mandy
You kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you

Oh Mandy won't you listen to what I've got to say
Oh baby don't you let me throw it all away
Oh Mandy won't you listen to what I've got to say
and I need you today oh Mandy..."
1949,1146.0,Westlife,My Love,"An empty street
An empty house
A hole inside my heart
I'm all alone
The rooms are getting smaller

I wonder how
I wonder why
I wonder where they are
The days we had
The songs we sang together
(Oh yeah)

And, oh, my love
I'm holding on forever
Reaching for a love that seems so far...

So I say a little prayer
And hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue
To see you once again
My Love
Overseas from coast to coast
To find the place I love the most
Where the fields are green
To see you once again

I try to read
I go to work
I'm laughing with my friends
But I can't stop to keep myself from thinking

1950,1727.0,Westlife,The Rose,"Some say love it is a river
that drowns the tender reed
Some say love it is a razor
that leaves your soul to bleed

Some say love it is a hunger
an endless aching need
I say love it is a flower
and you it's only seed

It's the heart afraid of breaking
that never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking that never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken
who cannot seem to give
and the soul afraid of dying that never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
and the road has been too long
and you think that love is only
for the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snows
lies the seed
that with the sun's love
in the spring
becomes the rose"

When I am down and, oh my soul so weary;
When troubles come and my heart burdened be,
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence,
Until you come and sit awhile with me.
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
You raise me up... To more than I can be.

And she doesn't give a damn about me.

Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby.
Yeah I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby.
Listen to Iron Maiden baby with me.
Ooohoo Hoo Hooooooo

Her boyfriend's a dick
He brings a gun to school
and he'd simply kick
my ass if he knew the truth
He lives on my block
He drives an I-ROC
But he doesn't know who I am
And he doesn't give a damn about me.

It's prom night and I am lonely
Low and behold, she's walking over to me
This must be fake
My lip starts to shake
How does she know who I am?
And why does she give a damn about me

(she said) I've got two tickets to Iron Maiden, baby
Come with me Friday, don't say maybe,
I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby like you . .

Then back to the hood so i can have the last laugh
Still laughing cuz i know im not a half
When we release we don't wanna half chart
The IQ is high some of them are half smart
But i do it like Ronson hard days craft

Rides a marter like Shaun Carter and the Wayne Carter
But next year im gunna step up a gear and go harder
You know me im a master i cause disaster, i cause disaster
Anywhere on earth find money like anywhere i surf
Plus anywhere i lurk the ropes have earnt the right to choose any stage anywhere i murk anywhere i am alert
Wanna make a decision, like being back in school doing revision.

Hey switch, turn it over and hit it
Turn around now, switch
Turn it over and hit it,

Hey, vibe to vibe a second, it's a club girl why you arrived neckin
Hear that, how the veteran glide the record
But don't download, go out and buy the record
Hey, something sexy 'bout her
Girl on the floor, all her friends around her
I mean real clean, ain't gotta touch or nuttin'
It ain't like I like a chick on chick or suttin'
I'm just a sucker for a hot track
Gimme a drink and a chick to tell 'Stop that'
Dance is a hop and a clap, flip it round
Now bring it on back, break it down
Now switch

Uh uh uh
I gotta question, I need to ask somebody
Why is it that when y'all see me at the party
Y'all be looking like, &amp;quot;Ooh, he a movie star
He ain't supposed to be out on the floor with everybody&amp;quot;
But oh wait, whoa, y'all forgetting
When I was, amateur spitting before the scripts were written
First one in, last one out the club
Bursting in, passing out in the club
Back at it, this cat is the wit and the charm
Taking you higher, like a syringe hittin' ya arm
Bringing the fire, making your Benz ring the alarm
Let me see you clap, spin baby, come on
Switch

[chorus (2x)]ooh la la la

Oh, you just gonna stand there, huh
What you too cute to dance, or you scared

It ain't really that hard to do and
I ain't trying to be in love with you and
All I wanted was a moment or two to
See if you could do that switch-a-roo and
Shut your mouth fool, get your crew and
The thick body and the rear one too and
I'll be right hear waiting on you to
See if y'all can do that switch-a-roo

Hey, hey

That's what I'm talking bout, do that thing mama

And have the whole world remember me
So touch mine and become a memory

[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
They ain't heard about me, although they got to be dead
With no soul in they body cause this how I lives
We middle finger cops like who y'all rolling on
Straight conversation I ain't with that holding on
You see me ho, I'm gone yeah that's that ray I roll
And ten patron shots, I'm way outta control

And this is what I tell 'em
Ugh, like what the fuck you yelling 'bout

Alluring lassos slide on so smooth
Tissue made of razors,
Dragging across you.

The flushing of eyes,
Couldn't cleanse your abrasions,
Deep inside consumed with guilt,
I'm clothed in a bed of blankouts,
Dream suspicious strangers over night.

Righteous pharisees befriending,
Silent movements mar reinjuring God,
The taste of absent minded actions outweigh forgiveness.

Briding a widow in spite of her venom,
I've failed to mention your soul,
Three becoming two.

Such a left in criminal,
Only the mind of the temptress knows,
Actions are my remorse for amnesia.

Righteous pharisees befriending,
Silent movements mar reinjuring God,
The taste of absent minded actions outweigh forgiveness.

So close to healing the weak,
Turning into the enemy,
Paralyzing kings.

We are so self,
Righteous pharisees befriending,
Silent movements mar reinjuring God,
The taste of absent minded actions outweigh forgiveness."

Ooooo...Shawty crunk on the floor wide open

With the strap around your ankles
Jangle, Jangle, Jangle
Call that bitch Bo'Jangles
Juicy like fruit or douche like coupe deville
Used to get loose on the goose for real

Five dollars get your ass a table dance
If you got ten, then bring a friend
Hoe shake your ass to the song then
If you ain't with it well go on then
We ain't no boys we grown men
If you ain't gon' dance well don't then
Why you wanna waste a nigga song then
See your ass down doing nothing

Bounce that ass up and down, make a nigga want it

Shake that shit, this ain't no mothafuckin' drill

Here's another ten bitch do it again
Work it like a game that you playin' to win
Make that pussy fart for the ying yang twins

Sixteen bitches with thongs in one club
The home of the 5th rated bones and big butts
Nice big pussys splittin' all over the floor
Hornafied, can't deny, certified pro
On a pole upside down (this shit for real)
Did the sixty-nine plenty of times to pay her bill
Brawd say she a clerk by night she turn stripper
You don't wanna date her you tryin' so you can tip her

Ooooo...Shawty crunk on the floor wide open
Skeet so much they call her billy ocean
Row, like a 18-wheeler

1981,1868.0,LL Cool J,I Can't Live Without My Radio,"[Verse 1]
My radio, believe me, I like it loud
I'm the man with a box that can rock the crowd
Walkin' down the street, to the hardcore beat
While my JVC vibrates the concrete
I'm sorry if you can't understand
But I need a radio inside my hand
Don't mean to offend other citizens
But I kick my volume way past 10
My story is rough, my neighbourhood is tough
But I still sport gold, and I'm out to crush
My name is Cool J, I devastate the show
But I couldn't survive without my radio
Terrorising my neighbours with the heavy bass
I keep the suckas in fear by the look on my face
My radio's bad from the Boulevard
I'm a hip-hop gangster and my name is Todd
Just stimulated by the beat, bust out the rhyme
Get fresh batteries if it won't rewind
Cos I play everyday, even on the subway
I woulda got a summons but I ran away
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
But I know I can't live without my radio

[Verse 2]
Suckas on my jock when I walk down the block
I really don't care if you're jealous or not
Cos I make the songs, you sing along
And your radio's def when my record's on
So get off the wall, become involved
All your radio problems have now been solved
My treacherous beats make ya ears respond
And my radio's loud like a fire alarm
The floor vibrates, the walls cave in
The bass makes my eardrums seem thin
Def sounds in my ride, yes the front and back
You would think it was a party, not a Cadillac
Cos I drive up to the ave, with the windows closed
And my bass is so loud, it could rip your clothes
My stereo's thumpin' like a savage beast
The level on my power meter will not decrease
Suckas get mad, cos the girlies scream
And I'm still gettin' paid while you look at me mean
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
But I know I can't live without my radio
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
And I know I can't live without my radio

[Verse 3]
Don't touch that dial, I'll be upset
Might go into a fit and rip off your neck
Cos the radio's thumpin' when I'm down to play
I'm the royal chief rocker LL Cool J
Let your big butt bounce from right to left
Cos it's a actual fact this jam is def
Most definitely created by me
Goin' down in radio history
I'm good to go on your radio
And I'm cold gettin' paid cos Rick said so
Make the woofers wallop and your tweeters twitch
Some jealous knuckleheads might try to dis
But it's nuthin', ya frontin', ya girl I am stuntin'
And my radio's loud enough to keep you gruntin'
My name is Cool J, I'm from the rock
Circulating through your radio non-stop
I'm lookin' at the wires behind the cassette
And now I'm on the right, standing on the eject
Wearin' light blue Pumas, a whole lotta gold
And jams like these keep me in control
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
And I know I can't live without my radio

[Verse 4]
Your energy level starts to increase
As my big beat is slowly released
I'm on the radio and at the jam
LL Cool J is who I am
Imma make ya dance, boogie down and rock
And you'll scratch and shake to my musical plot
And to expand my musical plan
Cut Creator, rock the beat with your hands

That's right, so don't try to front the move
As you become motivated by the funky groove
You can see me and Earl chillin' on the block
With my box cold kickin' with the gangster rock
See people can't stop me, neither can the police
I'm a musical maniac to say the least
For you and your radio I made this for
Cool J's here to devastate once more
Pullin' all the girls, takin' out MCs
If ya try to disrespect me, I just say Please!
Here to command the hip-hop land
Kick it live with a box inside my hand
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
But I know I can't live without my radio

Farmers Boulevard, yeah, you know that's where me and E hang out, cool
out, you know what I'm sayin'? That's where the crib's at."

I put on for my city, on on for my city (x4)

When they see me up in traffic they say Jeezy on some other shit
Send them pussy niggas runnin straight back to the dealership
Me I'm in my spaceship, that's right I work for Nasa
The 7H is not a fraud, call that bitch my bodyguard
Call that bitch your bodyguard? Yeah, that's my bodyguard
When we're out of jewelry Young gon' do security
It was whiter than a napkin, harder than a dinner plate
If you want it come and get it
You know I stay super straight
Ran up in my spots and now I'm workin at the Super 8
Know you niggas hungry, come and get a super plate
Y'all sing happy birthday, yeah I got that super cake
Hundred karat bracelet, I use it like some super freight

I put on for my city, on on for my city

Half bag, top back, ain't nothin but a young thug
HKs, 8 K's, I need to join a gun club
Big wheels, big straps, you know I like it super sized
Passenger's a redbone, her weed look like some curly fries
Inside fish sticks, outside tartar sauce
Pocket full of celery, imagine what she tellin me
Blowin on asparagus, the realest shit I ever smoked
Ridin to that Trap or Die, the realest shit I ever wrote
They know I got that broccoli, so I keep that glock on me
Don't get caught without one, comin from where I'm from
Call me Jeezy Hamilton, flyin down Campbellton
So fresh, so clean, on my way to Charlene

I put on... (x3)
I put on for my city, I put on for my
I put on for my city, I put on for my city
On

I feel like there's still niggas that owe me checks
I feel like there's still bitches that owe me sex
I feel like this but niggas don't know the stress
I lost the only girl in the world that know me best
I got the money and the fame and that don't mean shit
I got the Jesus on a chain, man that don't mean shit
Cause when the Jesus pieces can't bring me peace
Yo, I need just at least one of Russell's nieces
On... I let my nightmares go
I put on, everybody that I knew from the go
I know hoes that was frontin when they knew we was broke
They say damn, Yeezy Yeezy, you don't know us no more
You got that big fame homie, and you just changed homie
You can ask big homie, man the top sure lonely
So lonely
Let me see what we have tonight (what we have tonight)
I'm high as a satellite (satellite)
I see those flashin lights (flashin lights)

Man, this is how is goes down, where I stay

Then I'ma buy the bar up, later on tear the car up
Flip a new one by the mornin', nigga back crunk
Good Times, if you in the club blowin' good pine

Stay workin' back do', till every sack is sold
Ima hit you in the back wit' hot callico

When you hear &quot;Shorty in town&quot; hide ya' ho
Cuz aww shit, lil' buddy fire the dro'
